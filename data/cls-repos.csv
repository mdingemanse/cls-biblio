"6","What I can do with the right version of you: the impact of narrative perspective and (in)formal pronouns of address on reader's immersion","Readers experience stronger immersion while reading first-person narratives than third-person narratives. The impact of second-person narratives on immersion, however, remains unclear, despite the power of second-person pronouns to elicit high emotional engagement with texts and reader’s identification as the addressee and as a participant in the story. Further, languages such as French distinguish between formal and informal second-person pronouns, the suitability of which depends on the social situation, and the use of which impacts the perception of the interlocutor. We report on a self-paced reading experiment in which 111 French participants read short stories in first and in third person. Crucially, participants were directly addressed with ether formal or informal second-person pronouns in the final sentence as well as in a subsequent (off-line) questionnaire soliciting post-story attitude reports. Although we did not find significant differences between reading times with the different pronouns, participants reported higher immersion and emotional engagement after reading first-person stories than third-person stories. Moreover, the effect of first-person pronouns on immersion only occurred when participants were addressed with formal second-person pronouns. We take these findings as evidence for an effect of pronouns (first vs. third) on immersion via perspective shifts, and we moreover argue that the effect of being addressed with an unexpected (in this case, informal) pronoun can overrule such an effect, highlighting the importance of research into the impact of pronouns of address.","ru.cls.what_i_can_do_with_the_right_version_of_you_dsc_272","10.34973/gzx3-yk10","https://doi.org/10.34973/gzx3-yk10","what_i_can_do_with_the_right_version_of_you","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Editable","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"pronouns of address; processing; narrative; immersion; French",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sanchez Carrasco, P.

"25","Stress in Motion","The prosody of a second language (L2) is notoriously difficult to acquire. It requires the mastery of a range of nested multimodal systems, including articulatory but also gestural signals, since hand gestures are produced in close synchrony with spoken prosody. It remains unclear how easily the articulatory and gestural systems acquire new prosodic patterns in the L2 and how the two systems interact, especially when L1 patterns interfere. This interdisciplinary pre-registered study investigates how Dutch learners of Spanish produce multimodal lexical stress in Spanish-Dutch cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR vs. Dutch proFESsor). Acoustic analyses assess whether gesturing helps L2 speakers to place stress on the correct syllable and whether gesturing boosts the acoustic correlates of stress through biomechanic coupling. Moreover, motion-tracking and time-series analyses test whether gesture-prosody synchrony is enhanced for stress-matching vs. stress-mismatching cognate pairs, perhaps revealing that gestural timing is biased in the L1 (or L2) direction (e.g., Spanish profeSOR with the gesture biased towards Dutch stressed syllable -fes). Thus, we will uncover how speakers deal with manual, articulatory, and cognitive constraints that need to be brought in harmony for efficient speech production, bearing implications for theories on gesture-speech interaction and multimodal L2 acquisition.","ru.cls.stress_in_motion_dsc_192","10.34973/bk02-af45","https://doi.org/10.34973/bk02-af45","stress_in_motion","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Editable","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"second language acquisition; prosody; lexical stress; gesture-speech coupling; gesture",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"URL: https://osf.io/7dj54","Bosker, H.R.

"26","A further look: Is syntactic priming  a plausible underlying mechanism for syntactic satiation?","This dataset belongs to the research master’s thesis titled A further look: Is syntactic priming a plausible underlying mechanism for syntactic satiation? and contains data from an online syntactic priming experiment in which participants alternated in reading sentences (primes) and producing written descriptions of pictures (targets) (Experiment 1) and an online acceptability judgment task in which participants judged the acceptability of primes and targets on a 7-point Likert scale (Experiment 2). These experiments were designed to investigate whether syntactic priming could be a plausible underlying mechanism for the syntactic satiation effect. While previous research has explored the possible relationship between the two phenomena through the lens of the variable and lesser understood syntactic satiation effect (Do & Kaiser, 2017), the present study looked at the possible link between priming and satiation through the lens of the more robust syntactic priming effect. This was achieved by using double-object (DO) datives that were combined with verbs of varying degrees of bias towards the prepositional object (PO) dative as our stimuli in these experiments. We compared whether priming and satiation are similarly sensitive to two factors that have previously been shown to modulate the strength of the syntactic priming effect: verb alternation bias and cumulative exposure (i.e., the number of prime structures a participant has encountered at any given point in the experiment). It was predicted that, if priming indeed is the mechanism underlying satiation, syntactic priming and syntactic satiation should be similarly sensitive to these factors.

The dataset contains coded target utterances (picture descriptions) that were produced in Experiment 1, as well as (standardized) Likert-scale acceptability data from Experiment 2. Codebooks explaining the meaning of variables are included in the dataset for both types of data.

"48","Reading Beyond Borders (VI.VENI.201T.011)","This research proposes an in-depth and longitudinal investigation of second-language (L2) reading comprehension of primary school children (aged 8-12) in non-Western educational contexts. Many L2 speakers struggle with reading comprehension, but most studies have tried to explain these reading comprehension difficulties focussing on Western contexts. Building scientific theories solely on Western Educated Industrialized Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) countries will bias the development of generic principles of second-language acquisition, as these samples are not indicative of the general human population. The current study addresses this Western bias and expands the research field towards non-WEIRD contexts by targeting mother-tongue speakers of Akan and isiZulu (Niger-Congo group) and Cantonese (Sino-Tibetan group) in Ghana, South Africa, and Hong Kong, three former British colonies that have institutionalised non-native varieties of English. The research will answer two questions. Firstly, how does children’s English L2 reading comprehension develop over a longer period of time, and how can this development be predicted by L2 morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge? Secondly, how does children’s L1 language structure awareness predict the development of their English L2 morphological awareness, and, indirectly, their L2 reading comprehension? Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used as an analytical framework. This is the first longitudinal study in a non-Western context that investigates the role of L1 and L2 linguistic skills on reading comprehension development in English as a second-language. The unique comparison of both African and Asian countries that have institutionalised English in their societies allows for a coverage of considerable variation in English L2 populations in terms of L1 language characteristics, and socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Research findings will be unravelled and analysed for components that can be translated into pedagogical guidelines and teaching methods for multilingual classroom contexts.","ru.cls.reading_beyond_borders_dsc_928","10.34973/md31-t786","https://doi.org/10.34973/md31-t786","reading_beyond_borders","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable External","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"vocabulary knowledge; reading comprehension; morphological awareness; cross-linguistic transfer; bilingualism; English as a second language",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Stoffelsma, C.E.

"79","Testing Decomposition, Full-Listing, and Dual-Route Models for Morphological Processing in Visual and Auditory Word Recognition","Morphologically complex words like persons are theoretically processed either a) via decomposition into their morphemes (decomposition model), b) as a whole (full-listing model), or c) through a parallel combination of full-listing and decomposition mechanisms (dual-route model). We tested these three models against each other on the same dataset for the first time, comparing visual and auditory word comprehension. Using a simulation study, we found that it is possible to determine whether a synthesized distribution of response times was produced by either a decomposition, a full-listing, or a dual-route model. Based on this, we modeled response time distributions of a large scale visual and a large scale auditory lexical decision experiment in Dutch, focusing on three different suffixes. Our results indicate that during visual word recognition nouns with the plural suffix -en, nouns with the derivational suffix -heid, and verbs with the second/third person singular present tense suffix -t are retrieved as a whole. For auditory word recognition, we obtained the same results except for nouns with the plural suffix -en, for which all processing models were equally supported by the data. These results suggest that a full-listing model yields the best fit, regardless of the modality and regardless of the suffix. Our study emphasizes the importance of testing quantifiable predictions in the form of concrete model implementations, which has not been done in this field of research.","ru.cls.morphology_spoken_word_recognition_dsc_335","10.34973/jm3a-vj10","https://doi.org/10.34973/jm3a-vj10","morphology_spoken_word_recognition","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable External","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"visual word recognition; morphological processing; lexical decision; dual-route model; computational modeling; auditory word recognition",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Müller, H.M.

"113","Internationalisation in higher education; the role of L2 proficiency in study performance","We present the results of research into the academic writing skills of German students in ESL. Our database is a set of answers to open exam questions for an EMI bachelor in psychology. Our aim was to detect the characteristics of EFL that affect the comprehensibility of an academic text and its relation to study results. Four ESL language experts assigned CEFR levels to the texts and commented on grammatical accuracy, use of academic vocabulary and text coherence. First, we correlated the grades assigned by the course lecturer and the CEFR-levels. There was no correlation. Second, we analysed the linguistic comments. We found that the academic style is poorly mastered in this type of text. Finally, we did not find proof for communicative disturbance related to poor ESL proficiency. We conclude that informed content interpretation outweighs semantic coherence, and overrules grammatical and lexical non-native characteristics.","ru.cls.internationalisation_dsc_422","10.34973/qaqf-k148","https://doi.org/10.34973/qaqf-k148","internationalisation","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Editable","Radboud University","RU-HD-1.1",NA,"L2 in higher education",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zijlmans, A.H.M.","Zijlmans, A.H.M.",NA,163,33113963,5368709120,2021-05-25 07:49:08,2023-06-03 17:36:39,NA,NA,NA,0,0,71,16,15954346,35,8,2021

"129","The Family Size Effect in Visual and Auditory Word Recognition","Words with larger morphological families elicit shorter response times in visual lexical decision (e.g., Baayen, Lieber, & Schreuder, 1997), but in auditory lexical decision, family size effects have been reported to be facilitative (Winther Balling & Baayen, 2008), absent (Baayen, Wurm, & Aycock, 2007), or inhibitory (Winther Balling & Baayen, 2012). We revisit the auditory family size effect and different family size definitions by re-analysing data from two large lexical decision experiments. The results suggest that words with larger families elicit smaller response latencies not only in visual but also in auditory lexical decision. However, in auditory lexical decision, this effect is insignificant when the word contains a prefix. In both modalities, it is the degree of semantic similarity and the degree of form overlap between a word and its family members, rather than the mere presence of overlap, that seem to drive the family size effect.","ru.cls.family_size_effect_word_recognition_dsc_270","10.34973/yc4q-r262","https://doi.org/10.34973/yc4q-r262","family_size_effect_word_recognition","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable External","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"visual word recognition; morphological processing; lexical decision; family size; auditory word recognition",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Müller, H.M.

Respondents are also aware of the dynamic nature of address and differences between languages and cultures.

"141","Can Discriminative Lexicon Theory account for the family size effect in auditory word recognition?","Words with larger morphological families elicit shorter response times (RTs) in lexical decision experiments (e.g., Bertram, Baayen, & Schreuder, 2000). One possible account for this family size (FS) effect draws on Discriminative Lexicon Theory (Baayen et al., 2011), positing that morphological families strengthen relationships between forms and meanings. While Discriminative Lexicon Theory successfully explains FS effects in reading (Mulder et al., 2014), we will investigate whether it also does in listening. We employed the computational model LDL-AURIS (Shafaei-Bajestan et al., 2023), which is based on Discriminative Lexicon Theory, and show that, while it predicts auditory lexical decision RTs collected in a large-scale Dutch lexical decision experiment (BALDEY; Ernestus & Cutler, 2015), it does only partially explain the variance in the RTs that is explained by FS. This shows that Discriminative Lexicon Theory in its current form cannot fully explain FS effects in listening. We discuss possible reasons for this finding.","ru.cls.discriminative_lexicon_theory_family_size_effect_auditory_word_recognition_dsc_516","10.34973/x6v3-yj45","https://doi.org/10.34973/x6v3-yj45","discriminative_lexicon_theory_family_size_effect_auditory_word_recognition","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable External","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"morphological processing; lexical decision; family size; discriminative lexicon; auditory word recognition",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Müller, H.M.

"156","Demo/Koremo corpus for Dutch and Korean emotional speech","This paper presents the Demo / Kemo corpus of Dutch and Korean emotional speech. The corpus has been specifically developed for the purpose of cross-linguistic comparison, and is more balanced than any similar corpus available so far: a) it contains expressions by both Dutch and Korean actors as well as judgments by both Dutch and Korean listeners; b) the same elicitation technique and recording procedure was used for recordings of both languages; c) the same nonsense sentence, which was constructed to be permissible in both languages, was used for recordings of both languages; and d) the emotions present in the corpus are balanced in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance. The corpus contains a comparatively large number of emotions (eight) uttered by a large number of speakers (eight Dutch and eight Korean). The counterbalanced nature of the corpus will enable a stricter investigation of language-specific versus universal aspects of emotional expression than was possible so far. Furthermore, given the carefully controlled phonetic content of the expressions, it allows for analysis of the role of specific phonetic features in emotional expression in Dutch and Korean.","ru.cls.demo_koremo_corpus_dutch_korean_emotional_speech_dsc_899","10.34973/5kg3-9852","https://doi.org/10.34973/5kg3-9852","demo_koremo_corpus_dutch_korean_emotional_speech","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable External","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"Speech; Korean; Emotion; Dutch; Cross-linguistic",NA,NA,0,"URL: https://mirjambroersma.nl/pdfs/Goudbeek_Broersma_2010_Interspeech.pdf; URL: https://mirjambroersma.nl/pdfs/GoudbeekBroersma2010.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Broersma, M.E.; Goudbeek, M.; Choi, J.; Konopka, A.","Heuvel, H. van den (Henk); Broersma, M.E.",NA,521,34532776,5368709120,2023-06-21 08:40:15,2023-08-03 09:19:33,NA,NA,NA,0,1,52,2148,133701319,26,16,2023

"176","Beyond politeness: a corpus study of Spanish por favor","Here we investigate the use of the politeness marker por favor ‘please’ in a corpus of contemporary Spanish dialogues. We argue that por favor (hereinafter, PF) is in fact only occasionally used as an expression of politeness. Apart from these uses, we distinguish between cases where PF functions as a marker of illocutionary force and other discourse functions, that include the expression of impatience, disapproval or an intense desire. While the formulaic use of PF is mainly limited to routine situations in the public sphere, the other functions are typical of private conversations. Our argument is grounded in data taken from film scripts and literary dialogues.","ru.cls.beyond_politeness_dsc_354","10.34973/hge7-gh81","https://doi.org/10.34973/hge7-gh81","beyond_politeness","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Reviewable Internal","Radboud University","CC0-1.0",NA,"por favor; politeness; please",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mulder, G.J.; Sanchez Carrasco, P.

"197","Variation in the processing of grammatical norm violations","So far, processing studies on grammatical norm violations (GNVs) in Dutch (i.e., als ‘as’ in comparatives) have mainly focused on general differences between GNVs and their grammatical and ungrammatical counterparts. The present study is the first to also systematically investigate between-participant and between-construction variation in the processing of GNVs, using a self-paced reading task. Age and educational level were investigated as potential sources of between-participant variation, and between-construction variation was assessed by including three GNVs that vary in the amount of prescriptive attention they receive in society. Results indeed showed that the processing of GNVs was influenced by the age and educational level of participants. Moreover, different results were obtained for different norm violations. Based on these results, we conclude that it is very important to take into account differences between participants and constructions when studying the processing of GNVs.","ru.cls.variation_processing_grammatical_norm_violations_dsc_391","10.34973/ngj2-y614","https://doi.org/10.34973/ngj2-y614","variation_processing_grammatical_norm_violations","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0",NA,"self-paced reading; processing; grammatical norm violations; between-participant differences; between-construction differences",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1075/avt.00059.cos",NA,NA,NA,"Floris Cos; Hubers, F.C.W.","Hubers, F.C.W.","Floris Cos",371,95078969,5368709120,2022-11-17 08:28:41,2022-11-17 08:28:41,NA,2022-11-17 08:28:41,NA,0,0,230,7925,999973564,52,127,2022
"198","Unraveling interdisciplinarity: changing perspectives on interdisciplinary education, learning and learning outcomes","To fully utilize the potential impact of interdisciplinary learning, a better overview of the state of the research field, and empirical research into the effects and learning outcomes of interdisciplinary learning is needed. 
This project, therefore, aims to provide a detailed view on the current state of empirical research into the learning outcomes and design of interdisciplinary learning, and extend it by presenting empirical results from the interdisciplinary minor ‘Healthcare communication, management and organization’. 

This project has 4 subprojects:
1. The state of empirical evidence for interdisciplinary learning outcomes in higher education: a systematic review;
2. Intrdisciplinary learning and education: Broadening students' perspectives on healthcare communication; 
3. Interdisciplinary education affects student learning: a focus group study;

"200","A linguistic view on gender in medical interaction","Women’s and men’s experiences of health, healthcare trajectories, and health outcomes often vary. Explanations for these differences go beyond biological sex, and attention for the effects of psychosocial gender on health has increased in the past few years. Yet, many aspects of gender and its multiple dimensions in health remain unclear, such as the role of gender in medical interaction. A focus on physicians’ and patients’ language use in consultations, and on how their language use is connected to gender, could increase our understanding of how gender impacts health and healthcare. This dissertation focuses on general practice consultations, which constitute an important stage in in the medical trajectory. By adopting a multi-method approach that explores the connection between gender and language use in medical interaction from various angles, I aim to provide a linguistic view on gender in interactions between GPs and patients with common somatic symptoms.","ru.cls.role_gender_in_medical_interaction_dsc_973","10.34973/ps6t-xf47","https://doi.org/10.34973/ps6t-xf47","role_gender_in_medical_interaction","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0",NA,"Stereotypes; Language Use; Health; General Practice; Gender; Doctor-patient Interactions; Communication",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1386/jaah_00066_1; DOI: 10.12840/ISSN.2255-4165.026; DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110739",NA,NA,NA,"Plug, I.","Stommel, W.J.P.

After each email, participants had to score their appreciation of the company and the recruiter on five different scales each. We found a small effect of pronoun: Emails written in V were more highly appreciated than emails in T, irrespective of type of email (invitation or rejection) and irrespective of the participant’s age, gender and level of education.

"206","Past tense reference to the future","The simple past in Dutch, as in many other European languages, is not necessarily used to refer to a past eventuality. A Dutch example of a verb in simple past that does not refer to a past event, taken from the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN), is: ""Pa die ging morgen golfen"" ‘Dad is going to play golf tomorrow.’ Here, the past tense verb ging ‘went’ can be called a ‘fake past’, since it refers to a future eventuality, as can be seen from the adverb tomorrow. We argue that this use of the past tense is not modal, because it does not involve reference to a counterfactual, hypothetical, or unlikely eventuality. We present a Reichenbachian (1947) analysis of this use of past tense, in which we argue that while the eventuality takes place in the future, past tense is used to indicate that the point of perspective (R) is situated in the past (i.e. R-S-E).","ru.cls.past_tense_reference_to_the_future_dsc_541","10.34973/kypa-nk77","https://doi.org/10.34973/kypa-nk77","past_tense_reference_to_the_future","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0",NA,"spoken Dutch; point of perspective; future; fake past; Reichenbachian analysis",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1075/avt.00079.haa",NA,NA,NA,"Haans, H.; Hoop, H. de","Hoop, H. de (Helen); Heuvel, H. van den (Henk)",NA,4,31885,5368709120,2023-11-09 21:10:55,2023-11-09 21:10:55,NA,2023-11-09 21:10:55,NA,0,0,169,42,355412,18,19,2023

"208","Linguistic judgments in 3D","Linguistic judgment experiments typically elicit judgments in terms of the acceptability or surface probability of a sentence. There is evidence that the dimension of the scale on which sentences are judged influences the outcome of the experiment, but to date this evidence is only limited. This is not a trivial matter, as the elicited judgment data are increasingly considered the basis for inferences about linguistic representation. The present study investigates whether the dimension of the scale influences judgments. Sentences are judged in one of three dimensions: acceptability, probability, or aesthetics. Two distinct sets of experimental items are tested; one with cases of stigmatized variation (violations of the prescriptive norm) and another with cases of non-stigmatized variation (middle-field scrambling) in Dutch. The results show that participants take into account the scale dimension, both in stigmatized and in non-stigmatized variation. The results for stigmatized variation reflect a certain degree of conscious reflection based on the judgment scale; the effects in non-stigmatized variation, by contrast, are only main effects of instruction without changes in the relative pattern of judgments between conditions. These findings corroborate the idea that linguistic judgments of non-stigmatized variation are not the result of introspection in the technical sense, but automatic, multi-dimensional responses to a stimulus.","ru.cls.linguistic_judgments_in_3d_dsc_298","10.34973/k01s-ez17","https://doi.org/10.34973/k01s-ez17","linguistic_judgments_in_3d","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-4.0",NA,"scrambling; prescriptive grammar; judgment tasks; instructions",NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schoenmakers, G.T.","Schoenmakers, G.T.",NA,6,1911024,5368709120,2022-09-20 09:57:06,2022-09-20 09:57:06,NA,2022-09-20 09:57:06,NA,0,0,170,251,54758521,82,70,2022

"214","Language in medicine: Language use in clinical interactions about medically unexplained symptoms","Communication between a physician and patient can improve health outcomes. This means that, in addition to medical treatments, the talk during clinical interactions plays a role in patients’ recovery process. The role of communication in patient outcomes is especially relevant when patients suffer from medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), such as irritable bowels or fibromyalgia. Their treatment options are often limited, which leaves the clinical interaction as an important resource for symptom management. To understand and improve physician-patient communication, existing research in the field of MUS has extensively analyzed what physicians and patients with MUS talk about. It is assumed that how they communicate, so with what language use, is also essential during clinical interactions. Language use can elicit varying responses and affect patient outcomes. Yet, few empirical studies assessed language use variations during clinical interactions about MUS. These studies use quantitative content analysis to compare relevant linguistic markers in consultations about MUS versus medically explained symptoms.","ru.cls.language_in_medicine_dsc_633","10.34973/c589-yr79","https://doi.org/10.34973/c589-yr79","language_in_medicine","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","RU-HD-1.1",NA,"medically unexplained symptoms; language use; general practice; doctor-patient communication",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1016/j.pec.2019.07.00; DOI: 10.1016/j.pec.2018.05.002; DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110667",NA,NA,NA,"Stortenbeker, I.A.","Stortenbeker, I.A.; Das, H.H.J.",NA,82,16467459,5368709120,2022-05-04 15:58:15,2023-08-01 21:12:51,NA,2022-05-04 15:58:15,NA,2,0,338,235,159525681,178,15,2022

"221","Dutch argument doubling","Argument doubling, also known as (contrastive) left-dislocation, is common in spoken Dutch, but it is unclear exactly what triggers it. Earlier proposals in the literature showed that the construction is not used for marking contrast, and suggested it is used for marking shifted topics instead. However, the results from a Spoken Dutch Corpus study on argument doubling with proper nouns demonstrate that topic shift does not adequately characterize the construction’s function either. Further examination of our corpus data shows that at least for proper nouns, Dutch argument doubling mostly occurs when a new referent is introduced into the discourse, but that this referent does not necessarily become prominent in the discourse. We hypothesize that argument doubling is a way of giving speakers and/or hearers some extra time to establish and/or process the new discourse referent in the discourse, regardless of whether it will become a discourse-topic after its introduction.","ru.cls.dutch_argument_doubling_dsc_755","10.34973/spe7-1542","https://doi.org/10.34973/spe7-1542","dutch_argument_doubling","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0",NA,"topic-shift; spoken Dutch; proper nouns; prominence; left dislocation",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1075/avt.00090.wet",NA,NA,NA,"Wets, I.I.

"223","Claiming common ground with 'hoor'","In this article we conduct a pragmatic analysis of the Dutch utterance-final particle hoor (lit. ‘hear’). Apparently, hoor has contradictory uses. It expresses politeness (involvement, togetherness), but it can also contribute to the face-threatening force of an utterance. We argue that there is a core meaning that all uses share, which is that by adding hoor, speakers claim a proposition at issue to be part of the common ground. This core meaning will be shown to account for hoor’s key characteristics. Hoor expresses involvement and is often attached to speech acts that are intrinsically polite, such as apologizing and giving compliments. Also, while hoor never occurs in interrogative sentences, it can be used with a certain type of directive speech acts, namely those that are in the interest of the hearer or are presented as having shared interests.","ru.cls.claiming_common_ground_with_hoor_dsc_263","10.34973/j84r-cd49","https://doi.org/10.34973/j84r-cd49","claiming_common_ground_with_hoor","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0",NA,"subtitles; speech acts; politeness; discourse particles; Dutch",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.1075/avt.00063.hoo",NA,NA,NA,"Hoop, H. de (Helen); Mulder, G.J.","Hoop, H. de (Helen)",NA,5,108080,5368709120,2022-11-07 15:14:31,2022-11-07 15:14:31,NA,2022-11-07 15:14:31,NA,0,1,69,183,3786945,41,50,2022

We found a clear preference for creo que among the native speakers of Spanish, but with differences between the main varieties of the language. For Dutch and German learners the preference for creo que was significantly weaker, and for beginning learners of Spanish it was significantly weaker than for advanced learners. While for the Dutch learners of Spanish this pattern reflects the preference for I think over I believe in their L1, the preference that the German-speaking learners have for creo que can be seen as evidence for a general tendency noticed in the literature, namely the interference of an L2 (in this case English) instead of the L1 (in this case German) in L3 performance (in this case Spanish).","ru.cls.creo_que_or_pienso_que_dsc_364","10.34973/5tq7-p857","https://doi.org/10.34973/5tq7-p857","creo_que_or_pienso_que","CLS","Data Sharing Collection",10,"Published","Radboud University","CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0",NA,"experiment; epistemic/evidential expression; German; Dutch",NA,NA,1,"DOI: 10.5565/rev/isogloss.212",NA,NA,NA,"Mulder, G.J.; Schoenmakers, G.T.; Hoop, H. de (Helen)","Hoop, H. de (Helen)",NA,5,123773,5368709120,2022-08-26 07:57:41,2022-08-26 07:57:41,NA,2022-08-26 07:57:41,NA,0,0,151,223,5160155,79,67,2022

"226","Appraisal of errors and infelicities produced by Dutch learners of German","Responses to questionnaire in German by  by German professionals [Germany; Spring 2016; qualtrics survey]
Abstract
One of the new scales in the CEFR Companion Volume (2018) is online interaction. The new descriptors cover goal-oriented online transactions, including written correspondence and the use of formulaic language. Dutch learners of German in business schools learn German for special purposes at B1/2-level: they are requested to master German well enough in a professional context, in order to facilitate interactions and transactions. The question is how their not always flawless attempts at inviting a member to a meeting is received by L1 language users. Is the level of B1/2 German sufficient to avoid bothersome situations? Is the mastering at B1/2-level enough to maintain a good relationship with a German partner? In order to find out whether communicative clashes might occur because of lack of appropriate language, 98 German business professionals, all L1 speakers of German, were asked to rate on a 7-point Likert scale pragma-linguistic infelicities and syntactic, lexical and morphological errors in 16 business e-mails written by Dutch learners of German. The results showed that pragma-linguistic infelicities were considered more bothersome than syntactic, lexical or morphological errors, which suggests L2 German writing courses should raise more explicit awareness of the pragma-linguistic force in intercultural communication, in line with suggestions of the new companion. Furthermore, it was studied whether knowledge of the writer’s foreign provenance and Dutch nationality affected the judgement of the German professionals. This was not the case.
