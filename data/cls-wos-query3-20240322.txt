J	Foolen, A				Foolen, Ad			Quo vadis pragmatics? From adaptation to participatory sense-making	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Cognitive linguistics; Cognitive science; Fragmentation; Participatory sense-making; Recontextualization	LINGUISTICS; LANGUAGE	Before looking forward, the past and present of pragmatics is reflected upon. Two developments are signaled as potentially problematic for the identity of the field. On the one hand, there is inner fragmentation in the field of pragmatics. On the other hand there are developments in neighboring fields like cognitive linguistics and cognitive science, which seek to recontextualize to the social-pragmatic dimension, this way coming closer to pragmatics. The two developments lead to the question what the core profile of pragmatics should be in order to play its own distinctive role in future research on human sense-making. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	de Graaf, A				de Graaf, Anneke			The role of identification and self-referencing in narrative persuasion	COMMUNICATIONS-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH			English	Article						narrative persuasion; identification; self-referencing	TRANSPORTATION; PROTAGONIST; SIMILARITY; RESPONSES; BELIEFS; EMPATHY	Previous studies have shown that identification and self-referencing can both function as mechanisms of narrative persuasion. However, it is not yet clear whether they are compatible and can work together in bringing about persuasive effects of narratives, or not. Therefore, this study examines both identification and self-referencing and studies their relation and effects. A 2x2 between-subjects experiment was conducted among 185 student participants, with the factors 'perspective' (1st vs. 3rd person) to influence identification and 'similarity' (young student protagonist vs. older working protagonist) to influence self-referencing. Results showed that identification mediated indirect effects of perspective on story-consistent belief and self-referencing mediated indirect effects of similarity on story-consistent belief. Moreover, identification and self-referencing serially mediated indirect effects on story-consistent belief. These results indicate that identification and self-referencing are compatible processes which can work together as mechanisms of narrative persuasion.

In this matched-guise experiment (N = 1699) the effects of L1 and L2 English accents and communication context were tested on speech understandability (intelligibility, comprehensibility, interpretability) and speaker evaluations (status, affect, dynamism). German (N = 617), Spanish (N = 540), and Singaporean listeners (N = 542) were asked to evaluate three accents (Dutch-accented English, standard British English, standard American English) in three communication contexts (Lecture, Audio Tour, Job Pitch). The main finding is that the Dutch-accented English accent was understood as well as the two L1 English accents. Furthermore, Dutch-accented English evoked equally positive evaluations to the two L1 English accents in German listeners, and more positive evaluations than the two L1 English accents in Spanish and Singaporean listeners. These results suggest that accent training aimed at achieving an L1 English accent may not always be necessary for (Dutch) English language learners, especially when they are expected to mostly interact with other L2 speakers of English. More generally, our results indicate that L2 English speakers' understanding and their evaluation of L1 and L2 Englishes would not seem to reflect traditional language norms. Instead, they seem to reflect the socio-cultural embedding of a language norm in a Lingua Franca English speech community that does not view accent varieties as a hindrance to successful communication.

J	Faro, L				Faro, Laurie			Monuments for stillborn children and disenfranchised grief in the Netherlands Recognition, protest and solace	MORTALITY			English	Article						Stillbirth; disenfranchised grief; monument; continuing bonds; death ritual; space	MEMORY	In the Netherlands, until the years mid eighty of the previous century, in accordance with the so called 'breaking bonds' paradigm at the time, children who had died around birth, were immediately separated from the parents. There and above, Roman Catholic rules dictated that children who had not been baptized before they died, would be buried anonymously in hideaway, and in the unconsecrated grounds of the graveyard. This article discusses these parents and their stillborn children. Their loss and grief remained for a long time unacknowledged, resulting in feelings of disenfranchised grief. These feelings increased as a result of the shift of paradigm into continuing bonds with a deceased, developing into the nowadays empathic and intimate contact between parents and stillborn children. With the emergence as of the year 2000 of monuments to stillborn children (in the Netherlands around 160 in total),monuments have become a strategy to cope with feelings of disenfranchised grief. This article concludes that parents of stillborn children benefit from an honourable place to commemorate and pay respect to their long-time publicly neglected child.

Cultural Value Adaptation in Advertising is Effective, But Not Dependable: A Meta-Analysis of 25?Years of Experimental Research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION			English	Article; Early Access						advertising; cultural adaptation; cultural dimensions; persuasion; globalization	PERSUASION; APPEALS; INDIVIDUALISM; CONSEQUENCES; PERCEPTIONS; PSYCHOLOGY; MESSAGES; IMPACT; TESTS	Advertisers sometimes use value appeals that are adapted to their specific cultural audience. After a meta-analysis in 2009 showing cultural value adaptation to be effective, new studies have been published and the advertising landscape has rapidly changed. The current meta-analysis involving about 120 comparisons of adapted versus unadapted value appeals on persuasion and ad liking presents three results. First, cultural value adaptation effects in advertising exist (persuasion: mean r = .049; ad liking: mean r = .055). Second, these adaptation effects have diminished over time (correlations between year of publication and persuasion effects: r = -.152; between year of publication and ad liking: r = -.185). Third, the adaptation effects do not allow for dependable advice for practitioners. We discuss these results in the context of globalization and the standardization-adaptation debate.

The question is whether this linguistic choice is advantageous, especially when the job advertised does not involve working in an international environment. Previous research of English loanwords in job ads has revealed that their effect in terms of the evaluation of the company, the job and the ad is limited if effects can be shown at all. Suggestions that English loanwords draw readers' attention because this language choice deviates from what readers expect and, in addition, take more processing time (because they are foreign) lack empirical evidence. The eye-tracking and behavioural data of our experiment did not provide any empirical evidence for the attention-drawing function of English loanwords nor an influence on their effectiveness in job ads geared to graduate students in Germany. We suggest that loanwords need a certain amount of processing to be identified as foreign. This means they are different from other salient cues that were shown to draw readers' attention because they are not subject to automatic processes. In addition, our participants were sufficiently proficient in English so that differences in processing time were not reflected in their eye-movement data.

We focused on two features: the fundamental human needs that were threatened, and the specific virtues that were portrayed. The results showed that the examined materials often included a combination of portrayals of threats to the fundamental human needs for safety, health and relatedness, and portrayals of the virtue of humanity, like love and kindness. Two subcategories could be distinguished in the materials, one in which the focus is on the portrayal of virtue as an answer to threatened needs, and one in which the focus is on the portrayal of threatened needs in which characters struggle even though they also have virtue.

These studies revealed that professionals may use empathy displays not only to validate the client's worry, but also to perform actions oriented to other institutional goals and tasks such as closing off a troubles-telling sequence. In this article, we present an analysis of empathically designed responses in Dutch telephone counseling. The data consist of 36 calls from the Alcohol and Drugs Info Line. In some of the calls, clients' troubles-telling includes emotion discourse', that is, descriptions of their feelings/emotions. Counselors may respond to these descriptions using conventional empathy displays like I can imagine that' and I understand that' in a range of verbal and prosodic variations. The analysis reveals that these responses open up advice sequences that vary in the extent to which they treat the client's articulated feelings as valid. Most are affiliating, treating the client's feelings as the basis for advice, while some are less affiliative, putting the client's feelings into perspective or implicitly questioning their legitimacy. Hence, empathically designed responses are pivots to advice-giving.

Two online experiments were carried out in which participants judged the strength of (un)intensified positive and negative evaluations in written dialogues. Both studies showed intensified language was perceived as stronger than unmarked language (i.e., language that was not intensified), and negative evaluations were stronger than positive evaluations. What is more, intensification and polarity interact; the increment of perceived strength for intensified positive adjectives (Study 1) and purely intensified adverbs (really, very; Study 2) was bigger than the increment in perceived strength of intensified negative adjective and adverbs. When a meaningful intensifier (deliciously, disgustingly) was used, the negativity effect remained. The findings were discussed within cognitive frameworks such as relevance theory, theory of mind, and theory on verbal aggression.

J	Huettig, F; Ferreira, F				Huettig, Falk; Ferreira, Fernanda			The Myth of Normal Reading	PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						dyslexia; literacy; reading; reading disorders	EYE-MOVEMENTS; AGE-DIFFERENCES; KNOWLEDGE	We argue that the educational and psychological sciences must embrace the diversity of reading rather than chase the phantom of normal reading behavior. We critically discuss the research practice of asking participants in experiments to read "normally." We then draw attention to the large cross-cultural and linguistic diversity around the world and consider the enormous diversity of reading situations and goals. Finally, we observe that people bring a huge diversity of brains and experiences to the reading task. This leads to four implications: First, there are important lessons for how to conduct psycholinguistic experiments; second, we need to move beyond Anglocentric reading research and produce models of reading that reflect the large cross-cultural diversity of languages and types of writing systems; third, we must acknowledge that there are multiple ways of reading and reasons for reading, and none of them is normal or better or a "gold standard"; and fourth, we must stop stigmatizing individuals who read differently and for different reasons, and there should be increased focus on teaching the ability to extract information relevant to the person's goals. What is important is not how well people decode written language and how fast people read but what people comprehend given their own stated goals.

In this two-stage content analysis, we examine the portrayal of physics in five major Dutch newspapers. Results show that astronomy and astrophysics is the most prominent field. Furthermore, newspaper articles are triggered almost equally by scientific and non-scientific events. Finally, the majority of described physics concepts are framed as difficult, but journalists do provide explanations for them.

Assessing the Salience and Greenness of Environmentally Friendly Packaging Cues	JOURNAL OF FOOD PRODUCTS MARKETING			English	Article						Product packaging; eco-labeling; mouse tracking; green consumerism; sustainability; environmental friendliness	EYE-TRACKING; MOUSE-TRACKING; CONSUMER; ATTENTION; CHOICES; DESIGN; BRAND; SUSTAINABILITY; EXPLICIT; BEHAVIOR	Environmentally friendly products become increasingly popular. To be considered for purchase, they must be (1) sufficiently salient and (2) perceived as environmentally friendly ("green"). The current paper investigates whether implicit (packaging material) and explicit (eco-labeling) packaging cues can facilitate such salience and greenness perceptions. We conducted a mixed-method, within-subjects experiment using self-report measures to assess perceived greenness, and mouse tracking as an exploratory measurement method to assess salience. Finally, we explored whether green consumerism, as a personal value, moderates these effects. Results confirm that both implicit and explicit cues that signalize environmental friendliness positively influence perceived salience and greenness. Furthermore, we find that implicit and explicit cues seem mostly independent in affecting salience and greenness perceptions and that green consumerism is no prerequisite for most of these packaging effects to emerge. As such, this research provides important new theoretical and practical insights on the role of packaging in food marketing.	[Ischen, Carolin; Meijers, Marijn H.

In family-style group care, young people temporarily live in the family of professional foster parents (PFP), while they regularly visit their birth parents (BPs). Our data consist of instant messaging of 11 pairs of PFPs and BPs during 2 months. Using Conversation Analysis (CA), we focused on the social interaction between BPs and PFPs, achieved in and through multi-modally constructed sequences of updates-responses. First, updates are used by BPs in the context of the transfer from the child from/to the PFP marking the transfer of responsibility for the child. Second, PFPs use images as updates to provide BPs quasi-primary access to the experiences of the child. Third, updates are given or elicited in the context of prior problems. Across these functions, we observe that while BPs work to display responsibility, PFPs subtly empower BPs as parents.

They demonstrated that people who are pre-exposed to weakened arguments against an attitude or position they currently hold (i.e., inoculated) are less affected by a subsequent strong counter-attitudinal message than people who are pre-exposed to arguments consistent with their attitude (i.e., supportive defense treatment) or to no arguments. Although these results significantly impacted both science and practice on a general level, rigid tests of the key theoretical propositions are lacking. We conducted a highly powered replication study (N = 679) and found that an inoculation treatment is more effective in increasing resistance toward persuasion compared to a supportive defense treatment and a no-treatment control condition. Our results were mostly consistent with McGuire and Papageorgis's original work.

A transcription-less quantitative analysis of aphasic discourse elicited with an adapted version of the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT)	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						aphasia; functional communication; transcription-less discourse analysis; ANELT	RELIABILITY	Background For speakers with mild to moderate expressive aphasia the ultimate goal of aphasia therapy is to improve verbal functional communication, which may be assessed with the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Test for Everyday Language (ANELT; Blomert et al., 1995). The ANELT is based on a qualitative and transcription-less method of analysis: the scoring is based on personal judgement and directly made from the recording of the test. Previous research (Ruiter et al., 2011) has shown that a quantitative measure for the ANELT not only allows verbal effectiveness (i.e., the amount of essential information conveyed) to be measured more sensitively, but also allows derivation of a measure of verbal efficiency (i.e., average amount of essential information produced per time unit). Although the quantitative scoring further improved the construct validity of the ANELT, there is a limitation that hinders its clinical application: the quantitative measure requires orthographic transcription of the spoken responses to the test. That is, the quantitative scoring is transcription-based. Aims In order to work towards clinical applicability of the quantitative measure of the ANELT, this study addressed the potential of a transcription-less variant of the quantitative analysis, in which the amount of essential information is directly quantified on the basis of recording, as a valid and reliable procedure for the measurement of verbal effectiveness. Methods & Procedures A total of 56 speakers of Dutch participated: 31 neurologically healthy speakers and 25 persons with aphasia. Monologic discourse elicited with 10 scenarios from an adapted version of the ANELT (Ruiter et al., 2016) was analysed with both a transcription-based quantitative method and a transcription-less quantitative one. Resulting data were systematically compared on the following psychometric properties: internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, construct validity, convergent validity, and known-group validity. Outcomes & Results Internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were good and comparable between both scoring methods. Only for one scenario did the transcription-based scoring method yield higher agreement among the raters. With respect to validity, both scoring methods seem to yield measures of the same underlying constructs, show a strong and positive correlation, and allow differentiation between persons with and without aphasia. Conclusions Although future research is needed to develop norm scores and investigate other psychometric properties, the result from the comparison demonstrated the potential of the transcription-less quantitative method as a valid and reliable method to analyse monologic discourse elicited with the adapted ANELT.

Based on the JSI Timestamped Web Corpora that are automatically POS-tagged and accessible via SketchEngine, this study compares French, German, Dutch, and English. After identifying the main names used to denote the virus and its disease, we extracted a total of 1,697 associated terms (according to logDice values) retrieved from news media data from January through October 2020. These associated words were then organized into categories describing the properties of the virus and the disease, their spatio-temporal features and their cause-effect dependencies. Analyzing the output cross-linguistically and across the first 10 months of the pandemic, a fairly stable semantic discourse space is found within and across each of the four languages, with an overall clear preference for visual and biomedical features as associated terms, though significant diatopic and diachronic shifts in the discourse space are also attested.

Knowing the entire story - a focus group study on patient experiences with chronic Lyme-associated symptoms (chronic Lyme disease)	BMC PRIMARY CARE			English	Article						Lyme disease; Chronic Lyme disease; Focus group; Patient perspective; Narrative analysis; Health communication	MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS; SUPPORT GROUPS; DIAGNOSIS; CANCER	Background Healthcare providers frequently struggle to provide effective care to patients with chronic Lyme-associated symptoms (chronic Lyme disease, CLD), potentially causing these patients to feel misunderstood or neglected by the healthcare system. This study is the first to use a combined medical and communication science approach, and aims to assess patients' experiences with CLD & CLD-related care, identify themes and repertories in these patients' narrations, and provide potential ways to improve communication with them. Methods Informed by the principles of 'clean language', we conducted focus groups with self-identified CLD patients (N = 15). We asked participants about their experiences with CLD and CLD-related healthcare. We performed thematic analyses using a bottom-up approach based in discourse analysis. We also sought to identify specific types of verbalizations (repertoires) across themes. Results Participants thematised a heterogeneous set of CLD-associated symptoms, which they frequently labelled as 'invisible' to others. Their illness significantly affected their daily lives, impacting their work, social activities, relationships with loved ones, hobbies and other means of participating in society. Negative experiences with healthcare providers were near-universal, also in patients with short-lived CLD-associated symptoms. Verbalizations were notable for frequent use of communicative modes that implicitly create common ground between participants and that give a certain validity to personal experiences (impersonal 'you' and other forms of presupposition). Conclusion Central themes found in CLD patients' communication are 1. the experience of significant symptoms, 2. for which adequate relief is only rarely found from conventional medical practitioners, and 3. that are largely invisible to the outside world. Verbalizing these themes, patients use various repertoires for their shared experiences, such as a feeling of abandonment or not being heard by the medical system, feelings of loss with respect to their previous health, and the idea that they might have been better off had they been diagnosed sooner. Working with these repertoires will enable healthcare providers to establish a shared perspective with their CLD patients, thus engaging in more fruitful doctor-patient communication. We hypothesize that these findings are not unique to CLD, but may also be applicable to other conditions with an uncertain aetiology, such as Long COVID.	[Baarsma, M. E.; Hovius, J.

Taking turns: bridging the gap between human and animal communication	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						human language; language evolution; animal communication; turn-taking; duets; antiphony	FREE-TAILED BATS; NAKED MOLE-RAT; VOCAL INTERACTIONS; ANTIPHONAL VOCALIZATION; CALL; EVOLUTION; RECOGNITION; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR; DOLPHINS	Language, humans' most distinctive trait, still remains a 'mystery' for evolutionary theory. It is underpinned by a universal infrastructure-cooperative turn-taking-which has been suggested as an ancient mechanism bridging the existing gap between the articulate human species and their inarticulate primate cousins. However, we know remarkably little about turn-taking systems of non-human animals, and methodological confounds have often prevented meaningful cross-species comparisons. Thus, the extent to which cooperative turn-taking is uniquely human or represents a homologous and/or analogous trait is currently unknown. The present paper draws attention to this promising research avenue by providing an overview of the state of the art of turn-taking in four animal taxa-birds, mammals, insects and anurans. It concludes with a new comparative framework to spur more research into this research domain and to test which elements of the human turn-taking system are shared across species and taxa.

Our pre-registered cross-sectional study design included an online survey in 12 languages with instructions for self-administering chemosensory tests with 10 household items. Between June 2020 and March 2021, 10,953 individuals participated. Of these, 5,225 self-reported a respiratory illness and were grouped based on their reported COVID test results: COVID-positive (COVID+, N = 3,356), COVID-negative (COVID-, N = 602), and COVID unknown for those waiting for a test result (COVID?, N = 1,267). The participants who reported no respiratory illness were grouped by symptoms: sudden smell/taste changes (STC, N = 4,445), other symptoms excluding smell or taste changes (OthS, N = 832), and no symptoms (NoS, N = 416). Taste, smell, and oral irritation intensities and self-assessed abilities were rated on visual analog scales. Compared to the NoS group, COVID+ was associated with a 21% reduction in taste (95% confidence interval (CI): 15-28%), 47% in smell (95% CI: 37-56%), and 17% in oral irritation (95% CI: 10-25%) intensity. There were medium to strong correlations between perceived intensities and self-reported abilities (r = 0.84 for smell, r = 0.68 for taste, and r = 0.37 for oral irritation). Our study demonstrates that COVID-19-positive individuals report taste dysfunction when self-tested with stimuli that have little to none olfactory components. Assessing the smell and taste intensity of household items is a promising, cost-effective screening tool that complements self-reports and may help to disentangle taste loss from smell loss. However, it does not replace standardized validated psychophysical tests.
