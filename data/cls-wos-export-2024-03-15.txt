Summaries are a natural way of presenting the important information gathered from dialogues. We present a unique data set that consists of Dutch spoken human-computer conversations, an annotation layer of turn labels, and conversational abstractive summaries of user answers. The data set is publicly available for research purposes. We used this data set to train and evaluate two transformer abstractive summarization models for Dutch dialogues. We briefly discuss the performance and errors of these summarization models and conclude that these models are not yet sufficient to be used in practice.

J	van Putten, S				van Putten, Saskia			Perception verbs and the conceptualization of the senses: The case of Avatime	LINGUISTICS			English	Article						perception verbs; lexical semantics; polysemy; Niger-Congo languages	POLYSEMY	Languages differ in their number of basic verbs that describe perceptual experience. Some languages have only two such verbs: one for visual perception and another for non-visual perception. How do speakers of these languages conceptualize sensory perception? To shed light on this question, this paper investigates the perception verbs mo 'see' and nu 'hear/feel/taste/smell' in Avatime (Kwa, Niger-Congo). These verbs are studied together with the constructions in which they occur, using both translated data and spontaneous discourse. Both perception meanings and meanings outside the domain of perception are taken into account. The detailed picture that emerges shows some previously undocumented patterns of perception encoding and enriches our understanding of the conceptualization of the senses more generally.

This makes it difficult to trace subtle differences that occur in mid-sentence position. We apply an analysis based on multivariate temporal response functions to uncover subtle mid-sentence effects. This approach is based on a per-stimulus estimate of the response of the neural system to speech input. Analyzing EEG signals predicted on the basis of the response functions might then bring to light condition specific differences in the filtered signals. We validate this approach by means of an analysis of EEG signals recorded with isolated word stimuli. Then, we apply the validated method to the analysis of the responses to the same words in the middle of meaningful sentences.

Whereas the human narrator is associated strongly with action verbs, preferring the Agent role, the inanimate narrator is much more limited to the Experiencer role, predominantly associated with cognition and sensory verbs. Our results show that animacy as a linguistic concept may be refined by taking into account the myriad ways in which an entity's conceptual animacy may be expressed: we accept the conceptual animacy of the inanimate narrator despite its inability to act on its environment, showing this need not be a requirement for animacy.

We review the risks of relying on proprietary software and survey the first crop of open-source projects of comparable architecture and functionality. The main contribution of this paper is to show that openness is differentiated, and to offer scientific documentation of degrees of openness in this fast-moving field. We evaluate projects in terms of openness of code, training data, model weights, RLHF data, licensing, scientific documentation, and access methods. We find that while there is a fast-growing list of projects billing themselves as 'open source', many inherit undocumented data of dubious legality, few share the all-important instruction-tuning (a key site where human annotation labour is involved), and careful scientific documentation is exceedingly rare. Degrees of openness are relevant to fairness and accountability at all points, from data collection and curation to model architecture, and from training and fine-tuning to release and deployment.

Using stimulus onset as the reference invokes models that assumes that relevant processing starts immediately, while stimulus offset invokes models that assume that relevant processing can only start when the acoustic input is complete. It is suggested that EEG recordings can be used to tear apart putative processes. EEG analysis requires some kind of time-locking of epochs, so that averaging of multiple signals does not mix up effects of different processes. However, in many lexical decision experiments the duration of the speech stimuli varies substantially. Consequently, processes tied to stimulus offset are not appropriately aligned and might get lost in the averaging process. In this paper we investigate whether the time course of putative processes such as phonetic encoding, lexical access and decision making can be derived from ERPs and from instantaneous power representations in several frequency bands when epochs are time-locked at stimulus onset or stimulus offset. In addition, we investigate whether time-locking at the moment when the response is given can shed light on the decision process per se.

J	Sanders, J; van Krieken, K				Sanders, Jose; van Krieken, Kobie			Traveling through narrative time: How tense and temporal deixis guide the representation of time and viewpoint in news narratives	COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article						deixis; news narrative; tense; time; viewpoint		This study examines the linguistic construal and cognitive representation of time and viewpoint in the genre of news narratives. We present a model of mental spaces that involves a News Space in which the deictic center is construed of the news actors at the time the newsworthy events took place, and a Reality Space in which the deictic here-and-now center of journalist and reader is construed. This model explains how the dynamic representation of narrative news discourse, characterized by shifts in time and viewpoint, is steered by linguistic devices. An analysis of Dutch news narratives shows that temporal adverbs such as yesterday and shifts from present tense to past tense may signal a move forward in narrative time, to a viewpoint in the future relative to the narrative now-point, rather than backward. These atypical time shifts can be accounted for by presupposing an Intermediate Space located at a point in time between the News Space and the Reality Space where the progression of narrative time comes to a halt and experiences are rather relived than reported. The salience of the Intermediate Space may be signaled by quotative conditionals reflecting the viewpoints of implicitly quoted sources. These results clarify how tense and temporal deixis steer the linguistic construal of time and viewpoint in news narratives, demonstrating that time and viewpoint are closely linked in the cognitive representation of these narratives.

Three aspects of framing at the thematic, lexical and syntactic level are defined: occurrence, marked description and prominence and, accordingly, a corpus of one hundred crime-news articles in Dutch and Iranian national newspapers is analyzed. Taking a systematic and replicable approach, it was found that crime-news narratives in the two countries frame crime and crime-related events in different ways with regard to the representation of participants, actions and circumstantial elements. The implication of these different framing patterns is explained in terms of different socio-cultural contexts and discussed with regard to the discourse culture of journalism. The study has implications for further exploration of the interdependence of discourse, context and cognition.

More specifically, we examined (a) how reliable L2 learners' intuitions are, (b) how much they differ from native speakers' intuitions, and (c) whether they are better predictors of L2 idiom knowledge than native speaker intuitions. To this end, Dutch native speakers and German L2 learners of Dutch rated 110 Dutch idioms on frequency of exposure, frequency of use, meaning familiarity, imageability, and transparency and were tested on idiom knowledge. This study shows that L2 learner intuitions about idiom properties are a valuable and reliable source of information on L2 idiom knowledge. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	van Halteren, H				van Halteren, Hans			Domain bias in distinguishing Flemish and Dutch subtitles	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Text classification; Dutch; Methodology; Dialect recognition; Topic bias		This paper describes experiments in which I tried to distinguish between Flemish and Netherlandic Dutch subtitles, as originally proposed in the VarDial 2018 Dutch-Flemish Subtitle task. However, rather than using all data as a monolithic block, I divided them into two non-overlapping domains and then investigated how the relation between training and test domains influences the recognition quality. I show that the best estimate of the level of recognizability of the language varieties is derived when training on one domain and testing on another. Apart from the quantitative results, I also present a qualitative analysis, by investigating in detail the most distinguishing features in the various scenarios. Here too, it is with the out-of-domain recognition that some genuine differences between Flemish and Netherlandic Dutch can be found.

This relatively new form of fact-checking receives a fair amount of attention from academics, with current research focusing mostly on journalists' motivations for publishing post-hoc factchecks, the effects of fact-checking on the perceived accuracy of false claims, and the creation of computational tools for automatic factchecking. In this paper, we propose to study fact-checks from a corpus linguistic perspective. This will enable us to gain insight in the scope and contents of fact-checks, to investigate what fact-checks can teach us about the way in which science appears (incorrectly) in the news, and to see how fact-checks behave in the science communication landscape. We report on the creation of FactCorp, a 1,16 million-word corpus containing 1,974 fact-checks from three major Dutch newspapers. We also present results of several exploratory analyses, including a rhetorical moves analysis, a qualitative content elements analysis, and keyword analyses. Through these analyses, we aim to demonstrate the wealth of possible applications that FactCorp allows, thereby stressing the importance of creating such resources.

J	van Krieken, K; Sanders, J				van Krieken, Kobie; Sanders, Jose			Smoothly moving through Mental Spaces: Linguistic patterns of viewpoint transfer in news narratives	COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article						viewpoint; mental spaces; news narrative; tense; temporal adverbs	DIACHRONIC CHANGES; DISCOURSE; SUBJECTIVITY; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; DEIXIS	This article presents a Mental Space model for analyzing linguistic patterns in news narratives. The model was applied in a corpus study categorizing various linguistic markers of viewpoint transfers between the mental spaces that readers must conceptualize while processing news narratives: a Reality Space representing the journalist and reader's projected here-and-now viewpoint; a News Narrative Space representing the newsworthy events from a there-and-then viewpoint; and an Intermediate Space representing the information of the news actors provided from a temporal viewpoint in-between the newsworthy events and the present. Viewpoint transfers and their markers were examined in a corpus of 100 Dutch crime news narratives published over a period of fifty years. The results reveal clear patterns, which indicate that both linguistic structures and narrative-based as well as genre-based inferences play a role in the processing of news narratives. The results furthermore clarify how these narratives have been gradually crystallizing into a genre over the past decades. These findings elucidate the complex yet fluent process of conceptually moving between mental spaces, thus advancing our understanding of the relation between the linguistic and the cognitive representation of narrative discourse.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate if variations in politeness modifications in English email requests by L1 versus L2 writers are evaluated differently by L1 and L2 readers. In an experimental study with a 2 (sender: Dutch English/L1 English) x 2 (politeness: less/more) design, 120 Dutch and 131 British participants evaluated one of four emails in which the politeness and the sender of the email were systematically varied. Results showed that senders were perceived as more bossy when the email contained less politeness modification than when the email contained more politeness modification. L2 writers were evaluated as being more authoritative and readers were more willing to comply with the request in L2 emails with less politeness modification than in emails with more politeness modification. An L1 English writer of an email with less politeness modification was seen as less competent than an L1 English writer of an email with more politeness modification. Thus, undermodification of requests may have a limited but important impact on how L1 and L2 email writers are evaluated. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

We begin with a discussion of the relation between levels of awareness and agency in the linguistic literature, focusing on the work of Von Humboldt, Silverstein, Van Coetsem, and Trudgill. Then we turn to the psycholinguistic notion of structural priming, aiming to show that cross-linguistic structural priming is a plausible mechanism driving contact-induced language change, and explore the properties of priming and its relation to the levels of awareness discussion in the linguistic literature. We end with suggestions for future research to further elucidate the relation between structural priming, levels of awareness, and agency in contact-induced language change.

JOURNALISM STUDIES			English	Article						Newspaper; narrative; quotes; credibility; engagement; realism	DIACHRONIC CHANGES; PERCEIVED REALISM; JOURNALISM; IDENTIFICATION; SIMILARITY; DIMENSIONS; DISCOURSE; QUOTATION; MESSAGES; STORIES	Current trends of declining newspaper circulation on the one hand and the public distrust in the news media on the other stress the need for journalistic texts that the audience finds to be both engaging and credible. This study therefore tests the effects of two quotation types-(1) reconstructive quotes presenting what was said and thought by news actors during the news events, and (2) attributive quotes attributing information to news sources after the events took place-on readers' engagement with and perceived credibility and realism of news narratives. In an experiment (N = 123), participants read a crime news narrative that included either only reconstructive quotes, only attributive quotes, both reconstructive and attributive quotes, or no quotes at all. Results indicated no differences between the four story versions in levels of engagement, perceived credibility and perceived realism. These findings challenge results from previous research as well as textbook recommendations, suggesting that readers' experience and critical evaluation of news narratives are not necessarily influenced by quotations.

The difference in length, which accompanied the qualitative difference of this pair, is affected as well. In mainland France, this tendency can be found to various degrees across the country, and is spreading throughout the speech community. This article further develops the picture of the current status of the low vowel contrast by investigating Belgian and Swiss French, where length is known to play overall a far more prominent role in the vowel inventories than it does in standard French. Are Belgian and Swiss French also affected by the merger of the two low vowels? To what extent can a difference in length and/or timbre still be found? And how do the patterns of contrast neutralisation/preservation relate to the developments in France?

J	van Mulken, M				van Mulken, Margot			What verbal de-escalation techniques are used in complaint handling?	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article; Early Access						De-escalation techniques; Responses to complaints; Complaint handling; Dealing with outrage	CONVERSATIONAL HUMAN VOICE; CRISIS PREVENTION; ONLINE; COMMUNICATION; STRATEGIES; INTERVENTION; DISCOURSE; RESPONSES; CONFLICT; BUSINESS	The amount of outrage language, hate speech and strong language in digital communication is steadily growing, but academic studies on how to deal linguistically with anger and outrage are still largely lacking. Social science studies focus mainly on behavioral actions, while only a few investigate situations in which aggression is successfully handled verbally. On the other hand, complaint handling via webcare has received considerable scholarly attention, but its focus was never on de-escalation techniques. This paper explores what verbal de-escalation techniques can be learned from webcare employees who succeeded in satisfying complainants. More specifically, it combines insights from the (im) politeness framework and conversational human voice approach (CHV) to show that webcare practitioners have developed a tacit consensus on how to use language to deal with complaints. In a study with a mixed methods approach, a Twitter (now X) sample of responses to complaints is explored to identify linguistic and rhetorical features that encourage de-escalation. Thirteen features, that can be grouped into three categories, contributed to mollify the initial complainant. They can be characterized as markers of empathy (1), authenticity (2) and verbal accommodation (3) and they may help to calm heated debates in domains other than webcare. This article extends previous research by merging both pragma-linguistic and corporate communication taxonomies of complaint handling routines, adding forms of stylistic internal modification as possibly successful deescalation features.

Seeking to explain this paradox, this research assessed conditions that motivate narrative processing of tragic movies about the loss of a loved one. Participants were assigned to a 3 (Mortality Salience of Self vs. Loved One vs. Control) x 2 (Movie Ending: Meaningful vs. Open) factorial design (N = 187), and then completed measures of death-thought accessibility, mixed affect, boundary expansion, and identification. The two different mortality salience conditions increased death-thought accessibility in the same way. However, only mortality salience of a loved one increased mixed affect for movies with meaningful endings, which, in turn, predicted identification with the protagonist and boundary expansion into the story world. The findings suggest that movies about toss with meaningful endings may invite viewers to emotionally process the fundamental fear of losing a loved one.

In three experiments, a total of 108 native Dutch participants listened to Dutch target sentences in the presence of three versions of the pop songs Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) (Experiment 1) or Hot N Cold (Experiment 2a and 2b) by singer Katy Perry at different signal-to-noise ratios. The versions consisted of the original English songs, the karaoke versions of the songs without lyrics, and anomalous versions of the songs in the fictional language Simlish, which was created for the video game The Sims. The songs were played in chronological (Experiments 1 and 2a) or in random order (Experiment 2b). Participants' task was to type the target sentence they had heard. In all experiments, speech intelligibility was better in nonlyrical (karaoke) than lyrical music (English and Simlish). In addition, listeners performed better in lyrics without semantic meaning (Simlish) than with semantic meaning (English). Finally, speech intelligibility was better when the song in the background was played in chronological rather than in random order. These findings aid in understanding the mechanisms involved during speech-in-music intelligibility. Public Significance Statement This study suggests that the presence of song lyrics and their meaning in the background negatively impact speech intelligibility. Additionally, hearing background music in its natural, chronological as opposed to a random order is beneficial for speech intelligibility.

J	Cucchiarini, C; Hubers, F; Strik, H				Cucchiarini, Catia; Hubers, Ferdy; Strik, Helmer			Learning L2 idioms in a CALL environment: the role of practice intensity, modality, and idiom properties	COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						Idiomatic expressions; L2 learners; CALL; idiom knowledge; cross-language overlap; transparency	FORMULAIC SEQUENCES; 2ND-LANGUAGE; FAMILIARITY; LANGUAGE; SPEAKERS; PROFICIENCY; LITERALITY; AVOIDANCE; CORPUS; GOOGLE	Idiomatic expressions like hit the road or turn the tables are known to be problematic for L2 learners, but research indicates that learning L2 idiomatic language is important. Relatively few studies, most of them focusing on English idioms, have investigated how L2 idioms are actually acquired and how this process is affected by important idiom properties like transparency (the degree to which the figurative meaning of an idiom can be inferred from its literal analysis) and cross-language overlap (the degree to which L2 idioms correspond to L1 idioms). The present study employed a specially designed CALL system to investigate the effects of intensity of practice and the reading modality on learning Dutch L2 idioms, as well as the impact of idiom transparency and cross-language overlap. The results show that CALL practice with a focus on meaning and form is effective for learning L2 idioms and that the degree of practice needed depends on the properties of the idioms. L2 learners can achieve or even exceed native-like performance. Practicing reading idioms aloud does not lead to significantly higher performance than reading idioms silently.These findings have theoretical implications as they show that differences between native speakers and L2 learners are due to differences in exposure, rather than to different underlying acquisition mechanisms. For teaching practice, this study indicates that a properly designed CALL system is an effective and an ecologically sound environment for learning L2 idioms, a generally unattended area in L2 classes, and that teaching priorities should be based on degree of transparency and cross-language overlap of L2 idioms.

Findings suggest that the effects of regional accents were limited. In the product commercial, the speaker with a moderate accent was attributed more warmth than a speaker with a standard accent. In the service commercial, the attitude towards the service was more negative for the moderate than for the standard accent.

J	Sanders, J; van Krieken, K				Sanders, Jose; van Krieken, Kobie			Exploring Narrative Structure and Hero Enactment in Brand Stories	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						archetype; brand story; brand video; catharsis; enactment; heroism; narrative; phronesis	STORYTELLING THEORY; IDENTIFICATION; PSYCHOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; CONNECTIONS; DISCOURSE; CRITIQUE; SELF	This study examines how audiovisual brand stories both invite and enable consumers to enact heroic archetypes. Integrating research on the archetypal structure of narratives with research on the event structure of narratives, we distinguish singular plot stories (i.e., stories that show a Hero's Journey) from embedded plot stories (i.e., stories that not only show but also tell one or more Hero's Journeys) and develop a conceptual and narratological framework to analyze their structural elements. Application of the framework to 20 brand stories representing 8 different brands reveals meaningful variation in elements between the singular plot stories and embedded plot stories. Differences in the expression of archetypes and event structure are argued to evoke different types of Hero enactment which in turn result in different outcomes. We specifically hypothesize that the enactment of heroic archetypes in singular plot stories primarily results in catharsis (pleasure), whereas the enactment of heroic archetypes in embedded plot stories primarily results in an outcome we describe as phronesis: a form of moral sense making of the self that advances one's practical wisdom and prudence. The final section of the paper discusses how cathartic and phronetic outcomes of hero enactment may foster the psychological bonding between brand and consumer, and invite consumers to align their moral values with the values that are reflected by heroic character traits. The central aims of the analysis presented are to provide an exploration of narrative phenomena in a reasonably broad range of brand story videos and foremost to provide a conceptual framework with an applicable instrument suited to analyze relevant categories in these brand stories. The present study is interdisciplinary in its approach to a contemporary, developing marketing phenomenon, applying psychological modeling of archetypes and heroic values with narratological insights on perspective-taking and story structure. Its contribution is to systemize, from a narratological viewpoint, how various narrative archetypes in brand video stories may contribute to the development of brand-consumer relations.

This paper applies a cognitive linguistic framework to analyze spontaneous perspective-taking in two corpora of stories told by people with a schizophrenia diagnosis. We elicited natural narrative language use through life story interviews and a guided storytelling task and analyzed the linguistic construal of viewpoint in these stories. For this analysis, we developed a reliable and widely applicable viewpoint model that allows for the categorization and quantification of speakers' linguistic presentation and navigation of spatiotemporal domains. We found that our participants skillfully presented, navigated and embedded different narrative viewpoints through a variety of linguistic viewpoint devices. They presented complex viewpoints of other people in both the here-and-now of the interaction and the there-and-then of a narrative, and made use of transition markers to demarcate spatiotemporal discourse domains. We found no differences in viewpoint variables when comparing their guided stories to a control group. If problems with intersubjectivity are indeed an essential part of schizophrenia, an explanation of how this group can take on and navigate complex linguistic viewpoints in natural narrative interaction is called for.

Hexanal, a molecule which smell resembles freshly cut grass, can increase trust in people. Here, we ask the question if smell can be leveraged to facilitate human-robot interaction and test whether hexanal also increases the level of trust during collaboration with a social robot. In a preregistered double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested if trial-by-trial and general trust during perceptual decision making in collaboration with a social robot is affected by hexanal across two samples (n = 46 and n = 44). It was hypothesized that unmasked hexanal and hexanal masked by eugenol, a molecule with a smell resembling clove, would increase the level of trust in human-robot interaction, compared to eugenol alone or a control condition consisting of only the neutral smelling solvent propylene glycol. Contrasting previous findings in human interaction, no significant effect of unmasked or eugenol-masked hexanal on trust in robots was observed. These findings indicate that the conscious or nonconscious impact of smell on trust might not generalise to interactions with social robots. One explanation could be category- and context-dependency of smell leading to a mismatch between the natural smell of hexanal, a smell also occurring in human sweat, and the mechanical physical or mental representation of the robot.

Information structural considerations influence both types of word order variation, and we demonstrate by means of a comprehensive corpus study that they have a comparable pattern: given objects tend to appear earlier in the sentence than new objects. We infer from this that the two types of word order variation are diachronically related. Our findings support an analysis of scrambling as object movement from a uniformly head-initial base via the specifier of VP to the specifier of vP. We argue that historical Dutch allows spell out of the object in its postverbal base position, but that this possibility was eventually lost. Consequently, the boundary between the given and new domains shifts from the verb to the adverbial.

In this paper we assessed the validity of the CLT as a measure of language proficiency in bilingual children, by determining the extent to which (i) age-matched, monolingual Spanish-speaking and Dutch-speaking children obtained similar scores, (ii) the CLT correlated with other measures of language proficiency in monolingual and bilingual children, and (iii) whether the factors underlying the CLT's construction, i.e., target words' estimated Age of Acquisition and Complexity Index, were predictive of children's scores. Our results showed that, while the CLT correlated with other measures and is therefore a valid means of tapping into language proficiency, caution is required when using it to compare children's language proficiency cross-linguistically, as scores for Dutch-speaking and Spanish-speaking monolinguals sometimes differed.

J	Dingemanse, M				Dingemanse, Mark			Between Sound and Speech: Liminal Signs in Interaction	RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION			English	Article							RESPONSE CRIES; LANGUAGE	When people talk, they recruit a wide range of expressive devices for interactional work, from sighs, sniffs, clicks, and whistles to other conduct that borders on the linguistic. These resources are used in the management of turn and sequence and the marking of stance and affect, and they represent an aspect of the interactional machinery that is as elusive as it is powerful. Phenomena long assumed to be beyond the purview of linguistic inquiry emerge as systematically deployed practices whose ambiguous degree of control and convention allows participants to carry out subtle interactional work without committing to specific words. While these resources have been characterized as nonlexical, nonverbal, or nonconventional, I propose that they are unified in their liminality: They work well precisely because they equivocate between sound and speech. The empirical study of liminal signs shows the promise of sequential analysis for building a science of language on interactional foundations.

J	Eekhof, LS; van Krieken, K; Sanders, J				Eekhof, Lynn S.; van Krieken, Kobie; Sanders, Jose			VPIP: A Lexical Identification Procedure for Perceptual, Cognitive, and Emotional Viewpoint in Narrative Discourse	OPEN LIBRARY OF HUMANITIES			English	Article							DIACHRONIC CHANGES; MENTAL SIMULATION; PERSPECTIVE; LANGUAGE; SUBJECTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; ENGLISH	Although previous work on viewpoint techniques has shown that viewpoint is ubiquitous in narrative discourse, approaches to identify and analyze the linguistic manifestations of viewpoint are currently scattered over different disciplines and dominated by qualitative methods. This article presents the ViewPoint Identification Procedure (VPIP), the first systematic method for the lexical identification of markers of perceptual, cognitive and emotional viewpoint in narrative discourse. Use of this step-wise procedure is facilitated by a large appendix of Dutch viewpoint markers. After the introduction of the procedure and discussion of some special cases, we demonstrate its application by discussing three types of narrative excerpts: a literary narrative, a news narrative, and an oral narrative. Applying the identification procedure to the full news narrative, we show that the VPIP can be reliably used to detect viewpoint markers in long stretches of narrative discourse. As such, the systematic identification of viewpoint has the potential to benefit both established viewpoint scholars and researchers from other fields interested in the analytical and experimental study of narrative and viewpoint. Such experimental studies could complement qualitative studies, ultimately advancing our theoretical understanding of the relation between the linguistic presentation and cognitive processing of viewpoint. Suggestions for elaboration of the VPIP, particularly in the realm of pragmatic viewpoint marking, are formulated in the final part of the paper.

We investigated to what extent 358 L1 Catalan and 338 L1 Spanish speakers in Catalonia differed in their general attitudes to Catalan and Spanish (explicit language attitudes) and in their reactions to the use of these languages in health advertising, specifically in an advertisement promoting COVID-19 vaccination (implicit language attitudes). This is the first study of its kind in a European multilingual context. Based on accommodation theory and theory related to first-language preference, participants were expected to prefer their L1 and the L1 advertisement. Findings offer support for first-language preference in terms of general language attitudes. However, the language of the ad and participants' first language had little impact on ad-related response. There were no effects of language on attitude towards the ad, attitude towards vaccination and vaccination intention, but the L1 Catalan participants felt the Catalan ad had more appropriate language and expressed more cultural respect than the Spanish ad. Thus, in the current study, explicit language attitudes revealed first-language preference, while implicit language attitudes did so to a limited extent.

We focused on two features: the fundamental human needs that were threatened, and the specific virtues that were portrayed. The results showed that the examined materials often included a combination of portrayals of threats to the fundamental human needs for safety, health and relatedness, and portrayals of the virtue of humanity, like love and kindness. Two subcategories could be distinguished in the materials, one in which the focus is on the portrayal of virtue as an answer to threatened needs, and one in which the focus is on the portrayal of threatened needs in which characters struggle even though they also have virtue.

For each fragment, they answered multiple-choice comprehension questions and rated the lecturer on comprehensibility, attitudinal measures (status, competence, likeability and dynamism), and perceived teaching quality. Findings showed that actual comprehension was not different for the English and the Dutch fragments. The lecturer was evaluated less positively in the English fragments than in the Dutch fragments in terms of status, competence, dynamism and teaching quality, but not likeability. A mediation analysis showed that language choice had no direct effect but only indirect effects on perceived teaching quality through comprehensibility and non-native pronunciation. Our study shows that the use of EMI instead of L1MOI would not appear to result in reduced comprehension but does result in more negative perceptions of the lecturer, and that non-native pronunciation contributes to these perceptions.

Effects of previous decisions on moral decision-making	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						moral decision-making; moral dilemmas; moral self-concept; previous decisions; sunk-cost effect; switching	PROCESS DISSOCIATION; SUNK COST; UTILITARIAN; DILEMMAS; JUDGMENT; LANGUAGE; CHOICE; MODEL; SELF; PREFERENCES	Previous studies have investigated moral decision-making by using moral dilemmas that involve a single decision. This article extends this paradigm, introducing two-stage scenarios to examine how moral decision-making is influenced by previous decisions in the same narrative-especially whether people tend to stay consistent or to reconsider within a morally challenging situation. It further compares decision-making between two-stage and one-stage scenarios. In Study 1 (N = 239), participants read scenarios requiring two successive decisions of harming one person to spare multiple people (utilitarian action), or vice versa (deontological action), within the same narrative. Second decisions were mostly found to be consistent with first decisions. Remarkably, inconsistent responding (switching) was robustly observed in about 29% of cases. Study 2 (N = 63), using one-stage scenarios, showed that having made a previous decision in the same narrative generally decreased utilitarian responding. Potential explanations for these phenomena are discussed. The present article concludes that prior choices within the same setting significantly influence decision-making. It also reveals the potential of gaining new insights using multiple-stage scenarios in moral decision-making research.

L1 influence in the use of initial adverbials in English novice writing	IRAL-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS IN LANGUAGE TEACHING			English	Article						Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis; novice writing; EFL; transfer; pragmatics		This paper examines the use of clause-initial adverbials in English novice writing. Previous research has identified frequent use of such adverbials as characteristic of Dutch EFL writing. Our contrastive corpus analysis of novice writing by Dutch and Francophone learners as well as native speakers allows us to determine whether this use of initial adverbials is (a) a V2 transfer effect, (b) a general interlanguage feature, independent of learners' L1, or (c) a characteristic of novice writing in general, holding true for both native and nonnative writers. We will show that both learner groups are 'equally different' from the native-speaker novice writers in their frequent use of initial adverbials, but appear to have distinct underlying reasons for this linguistic behaviour: Francophone writers place adverbials in initial position more often for stylistic purposes, while Dutch writers have a stronger tendency to use initial adverbials for local discourse linking.

J	Hendriks, B; van Meurs, F				Hendriks, Berna; van Meurs, Frank			Attitudes to regional and standard accents in commercial and non-commercial contexts	LINGUA			English	Article						Regional accent; Standard Language Ideology; Language attitudes; Commercials; the Netherlands	ADVANCED DUBLIN ENGLISH; PERSUASION; DUTCH; MODEL; LECTURERS; RESPONSES; STRENGTH	Commercials regularly use non-standard accented speakers to promote products and services despite sociolinguistic findings that non-standard accents in non-commercial contexts are evaluated less positively than standard accents. Accent evaluations in commercial contexts may be different because of perceived relevance to the product or service or of perceived manipulative intent. To date, no studies have investigated whether identical accented speech fragments are evaluated differently in commercial and non-commercial contexts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of non-standard versus standard accented speech in commercial versus non-commercial contexts in terms of attitudes towards the speaker (competence, status, likeability, dynamism), comprehensibility, attitude towards the product, attitude towards the vlog, and perceived realism of the vlog. In a 2 x 2 between-subject design, 631 Dutch respondents evaluated Dutch standard-accented and regionally accented vlogs in either a commercial or non-commercial context. Findings show that commercial versus non-commercial context had no effect on the evaluations of standard and regional accents. In both contexts, a regional accent was evaluated more negatively than a standard accent for the majority of measures: attitudes towards the speaker (competence, status, dynamism), comprehensibility, attitude towards the product, and perceived realism of the vlog. These findings indicate that a regional accent is a potent negative cue across these contexts, overriding possible effects that are specific to commercial contexts.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

J	van der Meulen, M				van der Meulen, Marten			Are We Indeed So Illuded? Recency and Frequency Illusions in Dutch Prescriptivism	LANGUAGES			English	Article						prescriptivism; Dutch; frequency illusion; recency illusion; language norms; language use		In 2005, Arnold Zwicky posited two misapprehensions about language: the Recency Illusion, or the false idea that certain language variation is new, and the Frequency Illusion, the erroneous belief that a particular word or phrase occurs often. Since their conception, these concepts have received widespread attention in popular scientific linguistics, but quantitative research investigating their application is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to provide an empirical investigation of Zwicky's proposed illusions. It does so by collecting statements about recency ('this word is new') and frequency ('this construction occurs often') from a database of Dutch prescriptive publications (1900-2018). I assessed their accuracy by comparing them to linguistic sources, including dictionaries, and usage corpora and other data. Our research showed that recency statements were rare, but that frequency statements, especially using high frequency terms such as vaak ('often'), were commonplace. Compared to usage, most prescriptive recency and frequency statements for both lexis and grammar indeed constituted Zwickian illusions. This seems partly due to genuine erroneous or unsupported beliefs by authors, but also partly to prescriptive genre conventions and rhetorical choices. Our explorative research highlights the complex usage-prescriptivism interface, and argues for more research into this aspect of language perceptions.

It has been shown that this "missing-VP effect" is reversed in German and Dutch. The current study demonstrates that the same cross-linguistic difference holds for sentences judgments: Native speakers consider English double-embedded sentences more comprehensible and acceptable when the middle verb phrase is removed, whereas the same is not the case in Dutch. This interaction between language and grammaticality also appears in a within-subjects replication that tests Dutch native speakers in both languages. These results, in combination with earlier findings, give rise to a hybrid account according to which the missing-VP effect is caused by properties of the language as well as properties of working memory.

We argue in favour of animacy as an ontological category with human, animate and inanimate entities representing discrete subtypes in the domain of entities. We distinguish between conceptual animacy, which is a gradient notion, and grammatical animacy, for which discrete, binary oppositions are needed. The main aim of this paper is to argue for a distinction between overt and covert type shifts in animacy. On the one hand, overt shifts are linguistic solutions to type mismatches in the grammar. Crucially, these type shifts do not involve a shift in conceptual animacy. Covert animacy shifts, on the other hand, brought about by selectional restrictions or by the linguistic context in general, do involve a proper type shift in conceptual animacy. By making explicit the relation between the gradience of conceptual and the discreteness of grammatical animacy, and by exploring the distinction between covert and overt type shifts that involve animacy, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of animacy and its effects on language.

J	van Krieken, K				van Krieken, Kobie			Multimedia Storytelling in Journalism: Exploring Narrative Techniques in <i>Snow Fall</i>	INFORMATION			English	Article						immersion; journalism; multimedia storytelling; narrative; Snow Fall	NEWS; DISCOURSE	News stories aim to create an immersive reading experience by virtually transporting the audience to the described scenes. In print journalism, this experience is facilitated by text-linguistic narrative techniques, such as detailed scene reconstructions, a chronological event structure, point-of-view writing, and speech and thought reports. The present study examines how these techniques are translated into journalistic multimedia stories and explores how the distinctive features of text, image, video, audio, and graphic animations are exploited to immerse the audience in otherwise distant news events. To that end, a case study of the New York Times multimedia story Snow Fall is carried out. Results show that scenes are vividly reconstructed through a combination of text, image, video, and graphic animation. The story's event structure is expressed in text and picture, while combinations of text, video, and audio are used to represent the events from the viewpoints of news actors. Although text is still central to all narrative techniques, it is complemented with other media formats to create various multimedia combinations, each intensifying the experience of immersion.

J	van Krieken, K				van Krieken, Kobie			Story character, news source or vox pop? Representations and roles of citizen perspectives in crime news narratives	JOURNALISM			English	Article						Character; citizen; crime news; narrative; news source; vox pop	ORDINARY PEOPLE	This study analyzes citizen representations in a corpus of 300 Dutch newspaper narratives published between 1860 and 2009. Results show that citizen perspectives are more frequently represented than authority perspectives, although the perspectives of authorities have become somewhat more frequent over time. In-depth analyses of the citizen perspectives show that citizens may fulfil multiple roles in the crime narratives, leading up to a functional typology of citizens as (1) story characters experiencing the news events, (2) news sources providing inside information about the events, and (3) vox pops expressing opinions and evaluations of the events. The variety of citizen perspectives included in crime news narratives and the multitude of roles they fulfill may help audience members to become informed as well as engaged and to explore their personal emotions, which may ultimately reinforce moral, cultural and societal values.

Toward Computational Models of Multilingual Sentence Processing	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Review						multilingualism; sentence processing; computational models; probabilistic grammars; neural networks	WORD RECOGNITION; WORKING-MEMORY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; PREDICTION; SPEAKING; N400; 1ST	Although computational models can simulate aspects of human sentence processing, research on this topic has remained almost exclusively limited to the single language case. The current review presents an overview of the state of the art in computational cognitive models of sentence processing, and discusses how recent sentence-processing models can be used to study bi- and multilingualism. Recent results from cognitive modeling and computational linguistics suggest that phenomena specific to bilingualism can emerge from systems that have no dedicated components for handling multiple languages. Hence, accounting for human bi-/multilingualism may not require models that are much more sophisticated than those for the monolingual case.

This study examined the relationship between phonological awareness and perception in Dutch younger and older adult L2 listeners, focusing on English contrasts of two types: a familiar contrast in an unfamiliar position (word-final /t/-/d/) and an unfamiliar contrast (/ae/-/epsilon/). Awareness was assessed with a task in which written minimal pairs and homophone pairs had to be judged as sounding the same or different. Perception was assessed with a two-alternative forced-choice identification task with auditorily presented words from minimal pairs. We investigated whether listeners' awareness and perception improved after a video-based explicit instruction that oriented their attention to one of these contrasts, and we tested whether including information about the phonetic cue of vowel duration increased learning. Awareness and perception of each contrast were shown to be moderately correlated at the study's outset. Furthermore, awareness and perception for each contrast generally improved more after the instruction drawing attention to that contrast. However, the effectiveness of explicit phonetic instruction varied depending on the combination of the contrast, cue information, and listener age group.

We argue that such disturbances have linguistic counterparts in the use of deixis: linguistic elements of which the interpretation relies on the situational context of the discourse and their connection to a subject-bound perspective. The DNN connects such linguistic phenomena to three viewpoint disturbances, which can manifest in different degrees of extremity: (i) the reduced capacity to recognize one's own subjective perspective and the subjective perspectives of others; (ii) the reduced capacity to separate present perspectives from distinct past, future, and hypothetical perspectives; and (iii) the reduced capacity to integrate projected viewpoint structures into the actual here-and-now. We explain how application of the DNN to language in schizophrenia enables the localization of perspectivization disturbances and helps to clarify the nature of disturbances in the ability to build complex viewpoint structures in language as well as cognition.

It is also essential for computational approaches to natural language processing. In this study we focus on negation detection in Dutch spoken human-computer conversations. Since there exists no Dutch (dialogue) corpus annotated for negation we have annotated a Dutch corpus sample to evaluate our method for automatic negation detection. We use transfer learning and trained NegBERT (an existing BERT implementation used for negation detection) on English data with multilingual BERT to detect negation in Dutch dialogues. Our results show that adding in-domain training material improves the results. We show that we can detect both negation cues and scope in Dutch dialogues with high precision and recall. We provide a detailed error analysis and discuss the effects of cross-lingual and cross-domain transfer learning on automatic negation detection.

This analysis provides an insightful framework for a precise analysis of how OV word orders differ from VO word orders. We show in detail that OV with referential objects involves discourse-given objects. We then present a phase-based analysis from a VO base in which objects undergo feature-driven movement to spec,vP triggered by the information structure of the object. We propose that this analysis also yields a syntactic framework for analysing the derivation of preverbal quantified and negated objects, as well as a natural explanation for the stepwise loss of OV word order.

Typically, this research has used aggregated measures of exposure and use. The role of specific interlocutors and in particular older siblings has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we examine the impact of having an older sibling on the language environment and language development of a group of 31 bilingual Greek-Dutch toddlers aged 16 to 30 months growing up in the Netherlands. Approximately half (n = 14) of the toddlers had an older sibling. With respect to language environment, toddlers with older siblings were in general found to hear and use more Dutch at home than their first-born peers. There were however no differences between the two groups of toddlers in terms of parental language use. With respect to language development, toddlers with older siblings were found to score higher than first-born peers on measures of Dutch receptive vocabulary, productive vocabulary, and morphosyntactic complexity. For Greek, no such differences were observed. The findings are discussed in light of factors including family constellation, parental language proficiency, bilingual parenting strategies, and the wider sociolinguistic context.

As in the previous study, both traditional Superiority evaluations and modern Dynamism considerations (pertaining to media cool) were extracted, albeit with greater methodological care: we included a three-level accent strength variable in the stimuli, and measured Dynamism-evaluations on independently validated scales. While mildly accented Moroccan-Dutch speech was deemed less inferior than its strongly accented counter-part (though not as superior as any indigenous speech), Moroccan-flavoured speech was found to be the most dynamic in general. It is argued that the new data account for the increasing vitality of Moroccan-accented speech much better than previous findings, but also, and contrary to previous claims, that the Dynamism evaluations which power this vitality are not implicit or subconscious.

J	Lutzenberger, H				Lutzenberger, Hannah			Manual and Nonmanual Features of Name Signs in Kata Kolok and Sign Language of the Netherlands	SIGN LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article							SYSTEM; DEAF	Name signs are based on descriptions, initialization, and loan translations. Nyst and Baker (2003) have found crosslinguistic similarities in the phonology of name signs, such as a preference for one-handed signs and for the head location. Studying Kata Kolok (KK), a rural sign language without indigenous fingerspelling, strongly suggests that one-handedness is not correlated to initialization, but represents a more general feature of name sign phonology. Like in other sign languages, the head location is used frequently in both KK and Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) name signs. The use of nonmanuals, however, is strikingly different. NGT name signs are always accompanied by mouthings, which are absent in KK. Instead, KK name signs may use mouth gestures; these may disambiguate manually identical name signs, and even form independent name signs without any manual features.

J	Marcoux, K; Ernestus, M				Marcoux, Katherine; Ernestus, Mirjam			Acoustic characteristics of non-native Lombard speech in the DELNN corpus	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS			English	Article						Lombard speech; Non -native speakers; Native speakers; New speech corpus; Acoustics	VOWEL DURATION; CROSS-LANGUAGE; ENGLISH; DUTCH; PERCEPTION; WORDS; NOISE; INTELLIGIBILITY; PROMINENCE; LISTENERS	Lombard speech, speech produced in noise, has been extensively studied in native speakers, while non-native Lombard speech research is limited. This article presents the first corpus of non-native Lombard speech, the Dutch English Lombard Native Non-Native corpus, which includes plain and Lombard read speech from native American-English, non-native English (native Dutch), and native Dutch women. The location of contrastive focus is systematically varied in the sentences. We investigated how intensity, spectral center of gravity, word duration, and VOT varies in the corpus as a function of plain versus Lombard speech and whether it is modulated by the speaker's nativeness and of the language. We did not find differences in how the native and non-native English speakers adapted their English speech in noise, indicating that the Dutch non-native speakers produced Lombard speech similany to the native English. The comparison of the native Dutch and non-native English sentences produced by the same participants nevertheless suggests that, for all acoustic measurements except word duration, the Dutch speakers adapted their Lombard speech differently in native Dutch than in non-native English. Combined, this would indicate that, when speaking English, Dutch speakers adapt their way of speaking in noise to the way native English speakers do. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

If and how this distinction impacts consumers' appreciation in and beyond advertising has not received much attention. Quantifying consumers' appreciation in terms of the attitude toward the advertisement and toward the product, purchase intention, and price estimation, we show experimentally that customers' attitude toward the advertisement receives higher scores when the informal pronoun is used than when its formal counterpart is.

This makes it possible to compare its output with human listeners' behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. DIANA differs from existing models in that it takes more available neuro-physiological evidence on speech processing into account. For instance, DIANA accounts for the effect of ambiguity in the acoustic signal on reaction times following the Hick-Hyman law and it interprets the acoustic signal in the form of spectro-temporal receptive fields, which are attested in the human superior temporal gyrus, instead of in the form of abstract phonological units. The model consists of three components: activation, decision and execution. The activation and decision components are described in detail, both at the conceptual level (in the running text) and at the computational level (in the Appendices). While the activation component is independent of the listener's task, the functioning of the decision component depends on this task. The article also describes how DIANA could be improved in the future in order to even better resemble the behavior of human listeners.

For bilinguals with aphasia, the interplay with EC is complex. In this systematic review, we synthesize research on this topic and provide an overview of the current state of the field. First, we examine the evidence for EC deficits in bilingual persons with aphasia (bPWA). We then discuss the domain generality of bilingual language control impairments. Finally, we evaluate the bilingual advantage hypothesis in bPWA. We conclude that (1) EC impairments in bPWA are frequently observed, (2) experimental results on the relationship between linguistic and domain-general control are mixed, (3) bPWA with language control problems in everyday communication have domain-general EC problems, and (4) there are indications for EC advantages in bPWA. We end with directions for experimental work that could provide better insight into the intricate relationship between EC and bilingual aphasia.

In this study we explore possible explanations for this decrease by assessing variations in the degree of intertwinement between the voices of journalist and news source in a corpus of 528 indirect reports. Results indicate that in indirect reports from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the journalist's voice was typically either dominant over or strongly intertwined with the news source's voice. In later periods, the voices of journalist and news source seem to have become disentangled. The decrease in indirect reports in Dutch news stories might thus be explained by an increased avoidance of the subjective intertwining of voices and, correspondingly, an increased separation of responsibilities between journalist and news sources. In this sense, the pragmatics of indirect reports became similar to the pragmatics of direct reports, causing the grammatically embedding indirect mode to lose its distinctive function.

We propose that the phenomenon of crosslinguistic structural priming may well drive this process. We investigated this by focusing on dative sentence production by Papiamento speakers in Aruba and in the Netherlands. In experiment 1, Papiamento speakers in Aruba and in the Netherlands described dative events. The speakers in the Netherlands produced more Dutch-like structures than the speakers in Aruba, especially younger speakers. In experiment 2, speakers from the same populations heard a Dutch prime sentence before describing a dative event in Papiamento. Syntactic choices were influenced by the Dutch prime sentences, and, again, especially younger speakers in the Netherlands produced more Dutch-like dative structures. This combination of results suggests that Papiamento syntactic preferences in the Netherlands are changing as a function of contact with Dutch, and that crosslinguistic structural priming is a likely mechanism underlying this change.*	[Kootstra, Gerrit Jan; Sahin, Hulya] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Language Studies, POB 9103, NL-6500 HD Nijmegen, Netherlands	Radboud University Nijmegen	Kootstra, GJ (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Language Studies, POB 9103, NL-6500 HD Nijmegen, Netherlands.

J	van Krieken, K				van Krieken, Kobie			Ambiguous Perspective in Narrative Discourse: Effects of Viewpoint Markers and Verb Tense on Readers' Interpretation of Represented Perceptions	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article							INFORMATION	Narratives frequently represent perceptions that allow for multiple interpretations in terms of perspective: Perceptions can be interpreted from the narrator's viewpoint as well as the character's viewpoint. Two experiments examined the role of contextual viewpoint markers and verb tense in readers' interpretation of such ambiguous perceptions. Whereas verb tense did not affect perceptual attributions in Experiment 1, viewpoint markers did: Readers tended to ascribe an ambiguous perception more strongly to the character in stories with (vs. without) a viewpoint marker in the context. This finding was replicated and extended in Experiment 2, which examined the scope of perceptual attributions by measuring readers' interpretation of three subsequent ambiguous perceptions. Again, verb tense had no effect on perceptual attributions, whereas viewpoint markers did: Readers ascribed each of the three perceptions more strongly to the character in stories with (vs. without) a contextual viewpoint marker. These results advance our understanding of narrative perspective by revealing the influence of local linguistic viewpoint markers on readers' interpretation of stories stretches to the discourse level.

The aim of the present study was to investigate to what extent lecturers with slight or moderate Dutch accents or native British English accents are evaluated differently in terms of intelligibility, comprehensibility and attitudinal impressions by non-native and native English-speaking listeners. In an experiment, 189 Dutch listeners, 175 international non-native listeners and 158 native English listeners evaluated fragments recorded by moderately accented Dutch, slightly accented Dutch and native English speakers. Findings showed that the moderately non-native accented lecturers were evaluated more negatively than lecturers with slight or native accents by both Dutch and international non-native listeners, but not by native English listeners. This suggests that non-native listeners evaluate the accents of non-native lecturers according to native speaker pronunciation norms.

An explorative study of online childbirth narratives	WOMEN AND BIRTH			English	Article						Health communication; Decision making; Childbirth stories; Preferences; Social media	WOMEN SEEKING; HOME-BIRTH; INFORMATION; HEALTH; NEOLIBERALISM; EXPERIENCES; ADVICE	Background: Increasingly, pregnant women, as active online media users, incorporate media driven values on childbirth that may not agree with professional midwifery values. In Dutch midwifery practice, online searching for other women's stories is often discouraged. However, online birth stories attract women as a means to learn from one another's experiences of childbirth. Aim: This study aims to explore Dutch women's use of an online social media platform (Instagram) to represent childbirth by analyzing their narrative strategies. Method: A collection of 110 Instagram-linked childbirth narratives (2015-2017) were analyzed applying an approach of interpretative repertoires. Findings: The Dutch women in this study linked birth stories on their Instagram accounts that represented impactful experiences of childbirth. In their narratives, three interconnected repertoires are played out: sharing your story, going into details, and doing it yourself. This study highlights that narrative details of the online birth stories illustrate the physical and procedural obstacles that women overcame in giving birth. Discussion: Reporting their emotional experiences in detail, women's online sharing of birth stories puts a focus on their personal preferences and decision making, and may ease the way for medical interventions. Without giving explicit advice, personal online birth stories could be instrumental in reformulating the standards of what childbirth is, or should be, like. Conclusion: Social media networks allow women to exchange stories that structure narrating women's childbirth experiences and offer a structure for the lived or future experiences of others. This may have an impact on women's decision-making during pregnancy and childbirth. (C) 2018 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hogeweg, L				Hogeweg, Lotte			Dutch slurs and the descriptive-expressive distinction	GLOSSA-A JOURNAL OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article							SEMANTICS	There is a lot of debate about the meaning of slurs, which are words that refer to a certain group of people in a derogative manner. Many scholars (e.g. McCready 2010; Croom 2011; Gutzmann 2015) consider slurs, unlike their 'neutral' counterparts, to have both descriptive and expressive content. In this squib, I discuss initial data on the use of Dutch slurs and related terms on Twitter. The Dutch data show that 'neutral' labels sometimes seem to behave like slurs to some degree and that some slurs can be used as swear words without (seemingly) conveying any descriptive property. Based on these observations, I suggest that slurs may be part of a continuum of labels, ranging in the degree to which they have descriptive versus expressive content, entailing a gradual distinction between conversational and conventional implicatures in the lexical domain. A gradual view on conventionality in the lexical domain would moreover pave the way for a less fundamental distinction between expressive and social meaning. It is concluded that the debate on slurs would benefit from a broader and more empirical approach to pejorative terms for (groups of) people, as their actual use and interpretation can show a mixture of (degrees of) descriptive, expressive and social meaning.

The prolongation of the final state of one hand of a two-handed sign while the other hand continues to produce other linguistic material (a ' hold') has been analysed in the literature as a prime piece of evidence for the presence of prosodic domains such as the phonological phrase in the organisation of sign languages. It thus provided evidence for a prosodic level of organisation more generally. It was not clear in those studies, however, how these prosodic phenomena can be represented and how they relate to the underlying lexical form of signs. We propose a representation with three levels: lexical, surface level spell-out and post-lexical. An underlying lexical representation itself (such as provided by the Dependency Model of signs that we use here) cannot handle phenomena such as spreading across multiple lexical items. For these phenomena, an intermediate surface level is needed, to connect the underlying representation to the linear surface form (syllables) holding the spell-out of underlying features. The surface level spell-out in turn is integrated into the prosodic structure of the sequences of signs, where postlexical phenomena such as (meaningful or purely prosodic) spreading across signs and phrases occur. With regards to the second hand, the underlying lexical representation does not distinguish two independent articulators. A spell out process is needed to determine the dominant hand, as well as the position of the selected fingers, the orientation, and other features of the weak hand. Our overall conclusion is that: a) the prolonged presence of the non- dominant hand can indeed be seen as a phonological process; b) this process can be analysed in terms of spreading of features and feature clusters of manual signs; and c) other surface phenomena (such as cross-articulator assimilation or 'echoing') can also be analysed as feature spreading, and in that sense are not fundamentally different from full holds. Thus, by creating an explicit multi-layered formal representation, heterogeneous post-lexical phenomena such as buoys, prosodic spreading, weak prop and manual 'echoes' can be analysed in a unified manner. Our analysis strengthens the view of signed and spoken languages being similar even in the domain of post-lexical phonology, where at first sight the modality-specific phonetic differences in the surface form appear to be substantial.

J	Schoonen, R				Schoonen, Rob			Are reading and writing building on the same skills? The relationship between reading and writing in L1 and EFL	READING AND WRITING			English	Article						Reading; Writing; Relationship reading-writing; Subskills	LINGUISTIC KNOWLEDGE; GRADES 1; COMPREHENSION; LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; PROFICIENCY; COMPONENTS; FLUENCY; SPEED	This article investigates the relationship between reading and writing. We assume that these skills share a number of subskills as can be inferred from models of reading and writing. A set of these subskills are studied for the extent to which they can explain the common variance (correlation) between reading and writing. Data from a sample of Dutch students performing reading and writing tasks in Dutch and English as a foreign language, as well as tests for various Dutch and English subskills, both declarative knowledge and processing fluency, were analyzed using structural equation modeling to estimate residual correlations between reading and writing, controlling for subskills. Results show that declarative linguistic knowledge is a more likely source for the common variance between reading and writing than processing fluency, and the subskills seem to play a larger role in EFL reading and writing than in L1 reading and writing. However, the EFL patterns seem to develop in the direction of the L1 results in the course of three grades.

Basic understanding of the pension system is desirable as incorrect conceptions affect the attitude towards retirement and planning for retirement. Visuals, specifically visual metaphors, help to understand abstract concepts. In this study, we tested whether information on pension accrual, with a visual expressing a navigation metaphor, better communicates the basics of pension accrual, compared to information with a simple visual or a plain text version. Sixteen pension funds and 5449 respondents participated in the study. Results show that the navigation metaphor conveyed the best the concept that the future income gradually grows, and that the expected amount has not yet been granted. Conveying the gradual growth on its turn positively impacted efficacy beliefs with regard to checking the adequacy of the accrual and the attitude towards retirement. Findings suggest that the navigation metaphor functions as an organising principle that increases the effectiveness of retirement communication.

The corpus consists of a selection of eight chapters from Javier Marias's Spanish novel Asi empieza lo malo 'Thus bad begins', and its translations to English, Dutch, and French. We annotated 1579 verb forms in the Spanish source text for tense, and, subsequently, their translations in the other languages, distinguishing between two registers within the novel, i.e., dialogue and narration. We found that the vast majority of the Spanish tenses are translated one-to-one to their counterparts in the three languages, especially in narration. In dialogue, we found several deviations, which we could partially account for within an Optimality Theoretic approach by appealing to the notion of markedness along two different typological dimensions, namely, tense (present versus past) and aspect (imperfective versus perfective).

Proposing that this experience is relevant for people who have lost a loved one, the present research examined processing and effects of transcendent narratives of loss among the bereaved. Study 1 (N = 1,012) examined if personal experience with loss (grief severity, loss acceptance) increased mixed affect, transportation, identification, and appreciation of narratives of loss with, and without a reference to transcendence; Study 2 (N = 240) examined effects on elevation and connectedness. Findings showed that transcendent narratives of loss increased transportation, identification, and story appreciation especially for individuals with severe grief. Conversely, transcendent narratives of loss increased elevation, and connectedness especially for individuals with low grief. Findings suggest that transcendent narratives of loss resonate with severe personal grief. We found no evidence that a transcendent perspective on death reflects difficulty in accepting one's personal loss.

We produce synthetic and natural spoken versions of a well known semantic textual similarity database and show that our VGS model produces embeddings that correlate well with human semantic similarity judgements. Our results show that a model trained on a small image-caption database outperforms two models trained on much larger databases, indicating that database size is not all that matters. We also investigate the importance of having multiple captions per image and find that this is indeed helpful even if the total number of images is lower, suggesting that paraphrasing is a valuable learning signal. While the general trend in the field is to create ever larger datasets to train models on, our findings indicate other characteristics of the database can just as important important.

A systematic search of the scientific literature between 1998 and 2017 resulted in a set of 103 journal articles about narrative journalism. Their analysis reveals that the scientific field is dominated by essayistic and qualitative studies on printed forms of narrative journalism, with a focus on the history and style of narrative journalism, whereas systematic research on the function and impact of the genre is scarce. A framework is presented that synthesizes the hitherto isolated strands of research on narrative journalism and offers anchors for an empirical turn in narrative journalism studies.

As part of this work we are investigating articulatory feature classifiers that are able to create reliable and accurate transcriptions of the articulatory behaviour encoded in the acoustic speech signal. Articulatory feature (AF) modelling of speech has received a considerable amount of attention in automatic speech recognition research. Different approaches have been used to build AF classifiers, most notably multi-layer perceptrons. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to the task of AF classification. This paper aims to improve AF classification by investigating two different approaches: 1) investigating the usefulness of a deep Convolutional neural network (CNN) for AF classification; 2) integrating the Mel filtering operation into the CNN architecture. The results showed a remarkable improvement in classification accuracy of the CNNs over state-of-the-art AF classification results for Dutch, most notably in the minority classes. Integrating the Mel filtering operation into the CNN architecture did not further improve classification performance.

However, interference is likely to happen at a lexical level when the target language does not have its own lexicon. This is the case in international sign (IS), which can be defined as a mix of different sign languages, in which the lexical items are not fixed. This qualitative study analyses a dataset of interpretation from Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) to IS by a team of two Dutch, deaf interpreters at an international conference in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. We observed the occurrence of source NGT lexical items borrowed into the IS target output and considered the strategies used in this. The phenomenon was found to be recurrent. In addition, depending upon the type of lexical items, the strategies used to borrow NGT lexicon were found to differ. Thus, we have described the set of strategies and examined the results in comparison with previous findings. As a practical output, this study could inspire current and future IS interpreters to expand their set of interpreting strategies.

J	Nederstigt, U; Hilberink-Schulpen, B				Nederstigt, Ulrike; Hilberink-Schulpen, Beryl			Attention to multilingual job ads: an eye-tracking study on the use of English in German job ads	FOLIA LINGUISTICA			English	Article						attention; English loanwords; eye-tracking; job ads; multilingual ads	ADVERTISEMENTS; 2ND-LANGUAGE; RECOGNITION; MOVEMENTS; DUTCH	In many non-English-speaking countries, English loanwords in job ads seem to be very common. The question is whether this linguistic choice is advantageous, especially when the job advertised does not involve working in an international environment. Previous research of English loanwords in job ads has revealed that their effect in terms of the evaluation of the company, the job and the ad is limited if effects can be shown at all. Suggestions that English loanwords draw readers' attention because this language choice deviates from what readers expect and, in addition, take more processing time (because they are foreign) lack empirical evidence. The eye-tracking and behavioural data of our experiment did not provide any empirical evidence for the attention-drawing function of English loanwords nor an influence on their effectiveness in job ads geared to graduate students in Germany. We suggest that loanwords need a certain amount of processing to be identified as foreign. This means they are different from other salient cues that were shown to draw readers' attention because they are not subject to automatic processes. In addition, our participants were sufficiently proficient in English so that differences in processing time were not reflected in their eye-movement data.

Nineteen participants first rated 126 speech clips representing three regional accents (Randstad, Groningen, Limburg) in terms of the expected regional origin of the speakers and their accent strength. In a subsequent speaker evaluation study, 148 participants rated the 16 clips that emanated from Study 1 as the mildest and broadest accented male and female Randstad and Limburg speech. Crucially, accent strength variation reduced the alleged status asymmetry between the high-prestige Randstad and the low-prestige Limburg accent, since mild versions of the Limburg accent were significantly upgraded on superiority and dynamism. And broadly accented Randstad females were downgraded on superiority but not on dynamism. All in all, our findings necessitate a thorough revision of current thinking about accent-triggered impression formation in Dutch.

This paper presents a corpus study showing that the prescriptively "incorrect" singular agreement pattern is in fact the dominant pattern in Dutch. In order to explain this, we argue that this type of partitive construction often has a specific function in context, namely, to point out that the subject is special or extraordinary, usually for the reason presented by the relative clause. We apply a usage-based approach to this construction within the framework of Construction Grammar, arguing that the prevalent implicature of the subject's specialness has become a conventionalized part of the meaning of the construction. This analysis then can be used to explain the syntactic pattern of singular agreement within the relative clause. A similar albeit less pronounced pattern can be found in German.

J	Jol, G; Stommel, W				Jol, Guusje; Stommel, Wyke			The Interactional Costs of "Neutrality" in Police Interviews with Child Witnesses	RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION			English	Article							SEXUAL ASSAULT; CHALLENGES; PEOPLE; TALK	This paper concerns the interactional dilemma between displaying affiliation and doing being neutral. This dilemma is highly salient in police interviews with child witnesses where interviewing guidelines encourage police officers to take a neutral stance to avoid steering children's stories. In this article, we use conversation analysis to analyze childrens' volunteered accounts of their own role during the alleged offense, e.g., how they resisted. Such accounts make relevant affiliative uptakes such as approval, disagreement, or reassurance that may be seen as nonneutral. Hence, these accounts raise interactional dilemmas for police officers: Should they do what is interactionally relevant or follow the guidelines? Our analysis shows how police officers display and deal with this dilemma and that children may add to it by pursuing something more than neutralistic uptakes. The upshot of this analysis is that attempting to be neutral in interaction may cause apparently undesirable interactional difficulties. The data are from the Netherlands.

To study perceptual learning in an interactive dialogue setting while maintaining experimental control of the phonetic input, we employed an innovative experimental method incorporating prerecorded speech into a naturalistic conversation. Using both computer-based and face-to-face dialogue settings, we investigated the effect of two types of learning mechanisms in interaction: explicit corrective feedback and implicit lexical guidance. Dutch participants played an information-gap game featuring minimal pairs with an accented English speaker whose /epsilon/ pronunciations were shifted to /?/. Evidence for the vowel shift came either from corrective feedback about participants' perceptual mistakes or from onscreen lexical information that constrained their interpretation of the interlocutor's words. Corrective feedback explicitly contrasting the minimal pairs was more effective than generic feedback. Additionally, both receiving lexical guidance and exhibiting more uptake for the vowel shift improved listeners' subsequent online processing of accented words. Comparable learning effects were found in both the computer-based and face-to-face interactions, showing that our results can be generalized to a more naturalistic learning context than traditional computer-based perception training programs.

Motivated by DeKeyser's (2015) skill acquisition theory of second language acquisition, this study compares L2 listening development in study abroad (SA) and at home (AH) contexts from both language knowledge and processing perspectives. One hundred forty-nine Chinese postgraduates studying in either China or the United Kingdom participated in a battery of listening tasks at the beginning and at the end of an academic year. These tasks measure auditory vocabulary knowledge and listening processing efficiency (i.e., accuracy, speed, and stability of processing) in word recognition, grammatical processing, and semantic analysis. Results show that, provided equal starting levels, the SA learners made more progress than the AH learners in speed of processing across the language processing tasks, with less clear results for vocabulary acquisition. Studying abroad may be an effective intervention for L2 learning, especially in terms of processing speed.

Connecting social media data and crisis communication theory: a case study on the chicken and the egg	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Crisis communication; Network analysis; Twitter; Social Media; Framing; Fipronil	NETWORK ANALYSIS; TWITTER; REFLECTIONS; ANATOMY	In a crisis situation, communication is an important asset for safeguarding the reputation of an organization. The communication strategy that is used in a crisis influences the way people perceive the crisis. While extensive research is conducted and clear communication guidelines about crisis communication are provided, current research tends to focus on a single actor in a crisis within a homogeneous stakeholder group. In this article, we analyze whether and how different groups of stakeholders frame a crisis and the extent to which they attribute responsibility for the crisis to actors. The case concerns the use of an illegal lice detergent (fipronil) in eggs in the Netherlands in the summer of 2017. Based on the analysis of Twitter data related to the case using multiple methods (network analysis, a longitudinal analysis and the annotation of a sample of tweets), this study shows that a seemingly simple case in a single sub-arena has different subgroups that use different frames and attribute different responsibilities to different stakeholders. This result implies that a reconsideration of communication strategies during and after a crisis is needed.

It should also be possible for computational models to learn language directly from speech but so far most approaches require text. We improve on existing neural network approaches to create visually grounded embeddings for spoken utterances. Using a combination of a multi-layer GRU, importance sampling, cyclic learning rates, ensembling and vectorial self-attention our results show a remarkable increase in image-caption retrieval performance over previous work. Furthermore, we investigate which layers in the model learn to recognise words in the input. We find that deeper network layers are better at encoding word presence, although the final layer has slightly lower performance. This shows that our visually grounded sentence encoder learns to recognise words from the input even though it is not explicitly trained for word recognition.

Statistical vowel classifications obtained from the acoustical properties of the learner vowel realizations were compared to vowel classifications provided by native Dutch listeners. Both types of classifications were affected by the specific set of vowels included as stimuli, an effect caused by the large variability in Spanish learners' vowel realizations. While there were matches between the two types of classifications, shifts were noted within and between production and perception, depending on the vowel and vowel features. We considered the variability between Spanish learners further by investigating individual patterns in the production and perception data, and linking these to the learners' proficiency level and multilingual background. We conclude that integrating production and perception data provides valuable insights into the role of different features in adult L2 learning, and how their properties actively interact in the way L2 speech is perceived. A second conclusion is that adaptive mechanisms, signalled by boundary shifts and useful in coping with variability of non-native vowel stimuli, play a role in both statistical vowel classifications (production) and human vowel recognition (perception).

We explore exceptions to this presupposed semantic and temporal congruency in a corpus of spontaneous signed conversation by deaf users of Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). We identify specifying mouthings (words with a different meaning than the co-occurring sign), solo mouthings (uttered while the hands are inactive) and added mouthings (words added to a signing stream without their corresponding sign), and make a sentence-level analysis of their occurrences. These non-redundant mouthings occurred in 12% of all utterances, and were made by almost all signers. We argue for the presence of a code-blending continuum for NGT, where NGT is the matrix language and spoken Dutch is blended in, in various degrees. We suggest expansion of existing code-mixing models, to allow for description of bimodal mixing.

We measured distances between n-gram probability distributions in 1,000-word samples of tweets by about 13,000 Twitter user communities ranging from 4 to 51 participants, discussing one of five selected broad topic areas, in which strong content-bearing words were masked. We found that the language use is more similar in users from the same community than in users from different communities. This was to be expected for discussions of the same topic, where the community might focus on specific subtopics, but the effect was also found across-topic.

J	Hoetjes, M; van Maastricht, L				Hoetjes, Marieke; van Maastricht, Lieke			Using Gesture to Facilitate L2 Phoneme Acquisition: The Importance of Gesture and Phoneme Complexity	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						second language acquisition; phonemes; audiovisual; deictic gesture; iconic gesture; accentedness; comprehensibility	HAND GESTURES; SPEECH; COMPREHENSIBILITY; INTELLIGIBILITY; WORDS; ACCENT	Most language learners have difficulties acquiring the phonemes of a second language (L2). Unfortunately, they are often judged on their L2 pronunciation, and segmental inaccuracies contribute to miscommunication. Therefore, we aim to determine how to facilitate phoneme acquisition. Given the close relationship between speech and co-speech gesture, previous work unsurprisingly reports that gestures can benefit language acquisition, e.g., in (L2) word learning. However, gesture studies on L2 phoneme acquisition present contradictory results, implying that both specific properties of gestures and phonemes used in training, and their combination, may be relevant. We investigated the effect of phoneme and gesture complexity on L2 phoneme acquisition. In a production study, Dutch natives received instruction on the pronunciation of two Spanish phonemes, /u/ and /theta/. Both are typically difficult to produce for Dutch natives because their orthographic representation differs between both languages. Moreover, /theta/ is considered more complex than /u/, since the Dutch phoneme inventory contains /u/ but not /theta/. The instruction participants received contained Spanish examples presented either via audio-only, audio-visually without gesture, audio-visually with a simple, pointing gesture, or audio-visually with a more complex, iconic gesture representing the relevant speech articulator(s). Preceding and following training, participants read aloud Spanish sentences containing the target phonemes. In a perception study, Spanish natives rated the target words from the production study on accentedness and comprehensibility. Our results show that combining gesture and speech in L2 phoneme training can lead to significant improvement in L2 phoneme production, but both gesture and phoneme complexity affect successful learning: Significant learning only occurred for the less complex phoneme /u/ after seeing the more complex iconic gesture, whereas for the more complex phoneme /theta/, seeing the more complex gesture actually hindered acquisition. The perception results confirm the production findings and show that items containing /theta/ produced after receiving training with a less complex pointing gesture are considered less foreign-accented and more easily comprehensible as compared to the same items after audio-only training. This shows that gesture can facilitate task performance in L2 phonology acquisition, yet complexity affects whether certain gestures work better for certain phonemes than others.

J	Merkx, D; Frank, SL				Merkx, Danny; Frank, Stefan L.			Learning semantic sentence representations from visually grounded language without lexical knowledge	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						representation learning; semantic representations; multi-modal learning; semantic relatedness		Current approaches to learning semantic representations of sentences often use prior word-level knowledge. The current study aims to leverage visual information in order to capture sentence level semantics without the need for word embeddings. We use a multimodal sentence encoder trained on a corpus of images with matching text captions to produce visually grounded sentence embeddings. Deep Neural Networks are trained to map the two modalities to a common embedding space such that for an image the corresponding caption can be retrieved and vice versa. We show that our model achieves results comparable to the current state of the art on two popular image-caption retrieval benchmark datasets: Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) and Flickr8k. We evaluate the semantic content of the resulting sentence embeddings using the data from the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmark task and show that the multimodal embeddings correlate well with human semantic similarity judgements. The system achieves state-of-the-art results on several of these benchmarks, which shows that a system trained solely on multimodal data, without assuming any word representations, is able to capture sentence level semantics. Importantly, this result shows that we do not need prior knowledge of lexical level semantics in order to model sentence level semantics. These findings demonstrate the importance of visual information in semantics.

COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						Narrative; emotion; morality	ENTERTAINMENT	The neurocognitive model of Mixed and Ambiguous Emotions and Morality (MA-EM) makes a relevant case for putting non-unidimensional emotions and morality more prominently on the research agenda. However, existing research challenges its assumptions about the distinction between mixed and ambiguous emotions and morality, and how they relate to reflective versus simulative processing routes, in three respects. First, the emotional state of being moved is generally conceptualized as a non-ambiguous rather than an ambiguous emotion. Second, mixed emotions have been found to elicit reflection rather than simulation. Third, the morality of narrative characters is typically perceived as mixed rather than ambiguous.

We propose a bottom-up method to study responsive behaviour across 16 languages (8 language families) We use sequential context and recurrence of turns formats to identify candidate response tokens in a language-agnostic way across diverse conversational corpora. We then use UMAP clustering directly on speech signals to represent structure and variation. We find that (i) written orthographic annotations underrepresent the attested variation, (ii) distinctions between formats can be gradient rather than discrete, (iii) most languages appear to make available a broad distinction between a minimal nasal format 'mm' and a fuller 'yeah'-like format. Charting this aspect of human interaction contributes to our understanding of interactional infrastructure across languages and can inform the design of speech technologies.

J	van Krieken, K; Sanders, J				van Krieken, Kobie; Sanders, Jose			Storytelling on Oral Grounds: Viewpoint Alignment and Perspective Taking in Narrative Discourse	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						identification; narrative; perspective taking; storytelling; viewpoint alignment; interaction; conversation	STORIES; NEWS; TRANSPORTATION; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; COMPREHENSION; PERSUASION; SIMULATION; MEDIA; TENSE	In this paper, we seek to explain the power of perspective taking in narrative discourse by turning to research on the oral foundations of storytelling in human communication and language. We argue that narratives function through a central process of alignment between the viewpoints of narrator, hearer/reader, and character and develop an analytical framework that is capable of generating general claims about the processes and outcomes of narrative discourse while flexibly accounting for the great linguistic variability both across and within stories. The central propositions of this viewpoint alignment framework are that the distance between the viewpoints of participants in the narrative construal - narrator, character, reader - is dynamic and regulated by linguistic choices as well as contextual factors. Fundamentally, viewpoint alignment is grounded in oral narrative interaction and, from this conversation, transferred to the written narrative situation, varying between demonstration and invasion of the narrative subjects and guiding readers' route of processing the narrative (experiential versus reflective). Our claim is that variations in viewpoint alignment are functional to the communicative context and intended outcomes of narratives. This is illustrated with the analysis of a corporate journalistic narrative that comprises both interactional and non-interactional aspects of storytelling. The concept of viewpoint alignment further explains the oral fundaments of narrative discourse in conversational storytelling and poses new questions on the relation between the dynamic processing of stories on the one hand and their static outcomes on the other.

DIANA consists of three major interacting components: Activation, Decision and Execution. The Activation component computes activations of word candidates that change over time as a function of the unfolding audio input. The resulting set of word candidate activations can be associated with an entropy that is related to difficulty of the decision when one of these candidates must be selected at time T. The paper presents the close relation between entropy measures and the between-word competition during the unfolding of the auditory stimuli, and at the end of the stimuli if no decision could be made before stimulus offset. We present a way for computing the entropy that takes into account linguistic-phonetic constraints that play a role in speech comprehension and in lexical decision experiments. Using the BALDEY data set and linear mixed effects regression models for RT, we show that entropy measures explain differences between RTs of words with different morphological structure.

Method: Seventy-eight young adult participants completed two speech tasks, both operationalized as maximum performance tasks, to index their articulatory control: a diadochokinetic (DDK) task with nonword and real-word syllable sequences and a tongue-twister task. Additionally, participants completed three cognitive tasks, each covering one element of executive control (a Flanker interference task to index inhibitory control, a letter-number switching task to index cognitive switching, and an operation span task to index updating of working memory). Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to investigate how well maximum speech performance measures can be predicted by elements of executive control. Results: Participants' cognitive switching ability was associated with their accuracy in both the DDK and tongue-twister speech tasks. Additionally, nonword DDK accuracy was more strongly associated with executive control than real-word DDK accuracy (which has to be interpreted with caution). None of the executive control abilities related to the maximum rates at which participants performed the two speech tasks. Conclusion: These results underscore the association between maximum speech performance and executive control (cognitive switching in particular).

The first, and more traditional, generative hypothesis is that the similarities are due to an innate language faculty. There is an inborn 'grammar' with universal principles that manifest themselves in each language and cross-linguistic variation arises due to a different parameter setting of universal principles. A second perspective is that there is no inborn, innate language faculty, but that instead structure emerges from language usage. This paper purports to develop and illustrate a third perspective, according to which the structural similarities in human languages are the result of the way the cognitive system works in perception. The essential claim is that structural properties follow from the limitations of human cognition in focus.

We collected and analyzed retellings of the "Pear Story", addressing the building of, and navigation between, separate but interconnected mental domains by focusing on the use of a broad range of linguistic and narrative phenomena: interactive framing, evaluations, story plot construction, causal connections, reference and speech and thought representations. The results point towards great complexities and varieties in viewpoint reports and navigation between subjects, thereby shedding light on perspective-taking abilities and possible difficulties in this group of people. These findings advance research into the diverse and complex ways in which viewpoint can be represented and navigated in stories, while gaining a better understanding of how cognitive and experiential viewpoint disturbances might be expressed in non-neurotypical populations.

J	van Doorn, M				van Doorn, Maarten			Advancing the debate on the consequences of misinformation: clarifying why it's not (just) about false beliefs	INQUIRY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY			English	Article; Early Access						Misinformation; social media; social epistemology; veritism; intellectual autonomy; epistemic dependence	FAKE NEWS; CENSORSHIP; SUPPORT; AUDIENCES; DEMOCRACY; SCIENCE; TRUST	The debate on whether and why misinformation is bad primarily focuses on the spread of false beliefs as its main harm. From the assumption that misinformation primarily causes harm through the spread of false beliefs as a starting point, it has been contended that the problem of misinformation has been exaggerated. Its tendency to generate false beliefs appears to be limited. However, the near-exclusive focus on whether or not misinformation dupes people with false beliefs neglects other epistemic harms associated with it. Specifically, I show that misinformation also causes trouble for the epistemic goods of truth attainment, intellectual autonomy and debate pluriformity. Moreover, for each of these goods, I argue that emphasizing error-avoidance exacerbates, rather than mitigates, the harms caused by misinformation. These oversights and dilemmas show that prioritizing error-avoidance in the fight against misinformation is not a neutral default policy or necessarily a net positive. A shift in focus away from the spread of false beliefs as the main harm of misinformation is needed to better understand and counter its negative effects.

Here, using picture naming, we investigated language choice and switching in late Dutch-English bilinguals. We found that naming was overall slower in cued than in voluntary switching, but switch costs occurred in both types of switching. The magnitude of switch costs differed depending on the task and language, and was moderated by L2 proficiency. Self-rated rather than objectively assessed proficiency predicted voluntary switching and ease of lexical access was associated with language choice. Between-language and within-language switch costs were not correlated. These results highlight self-rated proficiency as a reliable predictor of voluntary switching, with language modulating switch costs. As in early bilinguals, ease of lexical access was related to word-level language choice of late bilinguals.

In this study, eighty-three news images from two hundred Iranian and Dutch news articles published in national newspapers were qualitatively analyzed. These images were scrutinized for their use of semiotic strategies as well as the overall visual pattern. The findings showed few similarities and notable differences between news images in the two cultural contexts. The Visual Pattern Analysis led to identification of six visual framing patterns. While Iranian images focus on non-identifiable arrested criminals, Dutch images frame crime in terms of identifiable victims and crime location. Remarkably, crime is rarely framed in terms of social causes and solutions in either corpus. The discussion links the findings to the socio-cultural contexts in which images are produced and received. The visual discourse analysis raised questions about the production and reception of crime news images to be investigated in future studies.

Idiomatic expressions are especially problematic, because they convey a figurative meaning that cannot always be inferred from the literal meanings of the component words. Researchers acknowledge that important properties that characterize idioms such as frequency of exposure, familiarity, transparency, and imageability, should be taken into account in research, but these are typically properties that rely on subjective judgments. This is probably one of the reasons why many studies that investigated idiomatic expressions collected limited information about idiom properties for very small numbers of idioms only. In this paper we report on cross-boundary work aimed at developing a set of tools and language resources that are considered crucial for this kind of multifaceted research. We discuss the results of our research and suggest possible avenues for future research.

While Dutch handbooks consider 'informing' the optimal function of journalism and news, Iranian handbooks put emphasis on 'increasing awareness'. Consequently, Dutch handbooks consider news as event and value information on facts, while Iranian handbooks aim for reporting the truth and consider news as on-going process. Specifically, as Iranian journalism handbooks value flexibility and creativity, they view storytelling style in news reports as the preferred journalistic genre and approach crime news as a special genre which should fulfill an educative function.

This is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration until one or more events happen, associated with a set of potential 'causes' (in our case the decision for a 'word' judgment as a function of conventional predictors such as lexical frequency, stimulus duration, reduction, etc.). In this analysis, RTs are considered a by-product of an (unobservable) cumulative incidence function that results in a decision when it exceeds a certain threshold. We show that Survival Analysis can be effectively used to narrow the gap between data-oriented models and process-oriented models for RT data from lexical decision experiments. Results of this analysis technique are presented for two different RT data sets. The analysis reveals time-varying patterns of predictors that reflect the differences in cognitive processes during the presentation of auditory stimuli.

The ventriloquist paradigm: Studying speech processing in conversation with experimental control over phonetic input	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							CONVERGENCE	This article presents the ventriloquist paradigm, an innovative method for studying speech processing in dialogue whereby participants interact face-to-face with a confederate who, unbeknownst to them, communicates by playing pre-recorded speech. Results show that the paradigm convinces more participants that the speech is live than a setup without the face-to-face element, and it elicits more interactive conversation than a setup in which participants believe their partner is a computer. By reconciling the ecological validity of a conversational context with full experimental control over phonetic exposure, the paradigm offers a wealth of new possibilities for studying speech processing in interaction.

In this study, we used semi-structured interviews with student advisors, students and teachers to investigate in more detail the role of foreign language proficiency in academic success. We identified three major language-related issues: (1) listening and speaking in discussion groups, (2) writing in examinations and assignments, and (3) the negative impact of language proficiency on grades. The quality and readability of the written assignments was repeatedly highlighted as the core problem.

It investigates whether, and to what extent, awareness-raising practices are currently implemented in EFL secondary education in the Netherlands, how these practices can be characterised, and how awareness-raising practices can be developed and further integrated into foreign language education. In a semi-structured interview, 10 teachers were asked to provide examples which they believed stimulated students' awareness of language. A total of 41 teaching practices were collected. Analysis of teaching practices revealed that approximately half of all self-reported practices could be characterised as awareness-raising. These practices often integrated multiple topics, included authentic contexts, back-and-forth interaction and provided students with the opportunity to reflect on their own and other students' language difficulties. At the same time, numerous practices which were reported as awareness-raising could not yet be characterised as such, indicating that teachers' notion of what constitutes an awareness-raising practice may be incomplete. Nevertheless, these practices provide interesting leads for awareness-raising opportunities. In sum, the analysis of practices presents a valuable opportunity for teachers to discuss their notion of awareness-raising practices. In addition, such an analysis could support teachers in adjusting their own teaching practices.	[van den Broek, Ellen W.

The role of grammatical gender in predictive processing in Russian children and adults	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			English	Article						grammatical gender; Russian; prediction; anticipation; adjectives	SPOKEN LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; TIME; WORD; AGREEMENT; SPANISH; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; NUMBER; MEMORY	This study investigated whether adult and 3- to 6-year-old native speakers of Russian can use gender-marked adjectives to predict the upcoming noun during sentence comprehension. In a visual world paradigm, participants heard questions (e.g., Gde horosij sinij ezik? "Where is the nice(masc) blue(masc) hedgehog(masc)?") including two gender-marked adjectives and a noun while seeing pictures of a target and a distractor of either the same (e.g., ezik "hedgehogmasc," miska "bear(masc)") or different gender (e.g., ezik "hedgehog(masc)," sobacka "dog(fem)") on the screen. We examined whether participants could use gender-marking anticipatorily (i.e., before the onset of the noun). Mixed-effects logistic regression analyses revealed that both adults and children anticipated the upcoming noun before its onset. The magnitude of the anticipation effect was stronger for adults than children. Subsequent analyses on the child data did not show evidence that age modulated their anticipation ability. The results of this study extend and improve knowledge regarding the role of adjectives that carry a grammatical gender cue in online sentence processing.

J	Goriot, C; van Hout, R				Goriot, Claire; van Hout, Roeland			Primary-school teachers' beliefs about the effects of early-English education in the Dutch context: communicative scope, disadvantaged learning, and their skills in teaching English	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND BILINGUALISM			English	Article						Early-English education; primary school; teacher beliefs; English education; English proficiency		We investigated whether primary-school teachers' beliefs towards early-English education are related to the type of English education they are involved in (early- or later-English schools), their English language skills and whether they teach English. Ninety-nine Dutch teachers filled in a questionnaire with 25 statements about early-English education, and assessed their own English speaking proficiency. Their beliefs were based on the effects of three distinct components: Communicative scope, Disadvantaged learning, and their own skills for teaching English. Regression analyses showed that teachers working at an early-English school generally hold more positive beliefs about the effects of early-English education than teachers working at a later-English school. Furthermore, teachers who taught English lessons themselves and teachers who assessed their own English speaking proficiency at a higher level, showed less negative beliefs about the effects of early-English education for Disadvantaged learning, and had more positive beliefs about their own English teaching skills. Teachers with a higher self-rated speaking proficiency showed more positive beliefs about the effects of early-English education on Communicative scope development. This study shows that teachers' beliefs and skills concerning English education are related to each other. Pre- and in-service training on providing English lessons should thus pay attention to both.

Unravelling upper-secondary school teachers' beliefs about language awareness: from conflicts to challenges in the EFL context	LANGUAGE AWARENESS			English	Article						Curriculum reform; EFL; interview study; language awareness; second language learning; teacher beliefs		This study presents an in-depth inquiry into teachers' beliefs about a language awareness approach to secondary school foreign language education. The study aims to deepen our insight into (the differences in) teachers' beliefs about language awareness and facilitate the discussion about including language awareness in foreign language curricula. Ten EFL teachers were interviewed about their beliefs about language awareness. Analysis of the interviews revealed that teachers do not have a shared understanding of the concept of language awareness as related to the five domains of language awareness set out. Furthermore, several beliefs could be characterised as conflicting. These conflicts were found in the context of student learning, teacher collaboration, the curriculum and the link with other languages. The results suggest a number of challenges that need to be addressed when including language awareness in foreign language education. These challenges could serve as a point of departure for a dialogue with and between teachers. Furthermore, they could support teachers to find out how language awareness fits best within the existing EFL curricula.

Video consultations have been found to be beneficial, but little is known about their organization, compared to face-to-face consultations. In this article, we explore potential extra interactional work conducted by participants in video-mediated consultations. We focus on the beginning of the consultation. Our data consist of 39 recorded, postoperative, oncological consultations, both face-to-face and through video-mediated communication (VMC), which we analyzed using conversation analysis. Although surgeons commonly launched the beginning with an announcement of the pathology report as the reason for the consultation, we found that in VMC, "how are you?" was regularly inserted after the testing of the technology. The question is a suitable strategy, as it displays overt other-attentiveness, while also being medically relevant. However, subsequently, surgeons may unilaterally close the elicited self-report to then address the pathology report. Thus, the "extra interactional work" of other-attentiveness is again attenuated.

The Impact of Video-Mediated Communication on Closed Wound Assessments in Postoperative Consultations: Conversation Analytical Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						video consultation; remote consultation; physical examination; assessment; patient-physician relationship; conversation analysis	PHYSICAL-EXAMINATION; ONLINE; VISITS; PATIENT; OBJECTS; MOBILE; CARE	Background: Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultations is increasing rapidly. Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that have focused on physical examinations in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in postsurgery consultations has not yet been studied. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of face-to-face and video settings on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of video technology on the procedure of postsurgery wound assessment and its limits. Methods: We recorded 22 postoperative video consultations and 17 postoperative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was to inform the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen, and the secondary purpose was to check on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of conversation analysis. Results: The way that an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (n=15/17) involve wound showings in the context of surgeons reporting their observations formatted with evidentials ("looks neat") and subsequently assessing what these observations imply or what could be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (n=3/22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments where diagnostic criteria such as redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty ("I think," "sounds...good") and evidentials are absent. Even in cases of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may rely on questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. Conclusions: The impact of video technology on postoperative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way when compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians enquire and patients provide their own observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that, in video consultations, patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in cases of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.	[Stommel, Wyke J.

JOURNAL OF ENGLISH AS A LINGUA FRANCA			English	Article						academic writing; ELF; English medium instruction; internationalization in higher education	ENGLISH	We studied German students' academic writing skills in English at a Dutch university. Their performances are typical examples of English as a lingua franca (ELF) as these students are non-native users of English evaluated by subject lecturers who are non-native users as well. Our database is a corpus of written answers to an open examination question in the context of an EMI (English Medium Instruction) bachelor in psychology. We aimed to detect those characteristics in this specific type of discourse that may affect the comprehensibility of the students' answers, which in turn may have consequences for their grading by the course lecturer. English language experts assigned Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) levels and commented on grammar, use of (academic) vocabulary, and text coherence. First, we correlated the grades assigned by the course lecturer and the CEFR levels. There was no correlation. Second, we analyzed the linguistic comments. We found that academic style was poorly present in this type of text. Importantly, we found no proof of communicative blockings or obstacles related to English proficiency levels between the student writer and the lecturer reader. We conclude that informed content interpretation based on contextual appropriateness of the answers overrules grammatical and lexical non-standard characteristics and outweighs the lack of semantic coherence.

LINGUA			English	Article						Language attrition; Idiomatic expressions; Dutch; Emigrants	LEXICAL ACCESS; ENGLISH IDIOMS; 1ST LANGUAGE; FAMILIARITY	Two studies are presented that investigated whether and to what extent emigration affects the knowledge of idiomatic expressions in the native language. Data on Dutch emigrant idiom knowledge were compared to data on idiom knowl-edge from two groups of Dutch non-emigrants differing in age. Research questions addressed a) possible differences in idiom knowledge between emigrants and non-emigrants, b) the effect of idiom properties such as familiarity and trans-parency on idiom knowledge in emigrants and non-emigrants and c) the effect of participant characteristics such as emi-gration length, use of Dutch, and age on idiom knowledge. The results show that a) when possible effects of age are minimized, only a small difference in idiom knowledge emerges between emigrants and non-emigrants; b) familiarity and transparency positively affect idiom knowledge in both groups and c) idiom knowledge of older non-emigrants is better than that of younger non-emigrants, while for emigrants a facilitatory effect of age is absent. We argue that this effect might have been obscured by that of emigration length, which has a negative effect on idiom knowledge. We dis-cuss the results with respect to those of previous studies and suggest possible avenues for future research.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Conventional approaches to manual segmentation are very labor-intensive. We introduce POnSS, a browser-based system that is specialized for the task of segmenting the onsets and offsets of words, which combines aspects of ASR with limited human input. In developing POnSS, we identified several sub-tasks of segmentation, and implemented each of these as separate interfaces for the annotators to interact with to streamline their task as much as possible. We evaluated segmentations made with POnSS against a baseline of segmentations of the same data made conventionally in Praat. We observed that POnSS achieved comparable reliability to segmentation using Praat, but required 23% less annotator time investment. Because of its greater efficiency without sacrificing reliability, POnSS represents a distinct methodological advance for the segmentation of speech data.

It revises an earlier definition to account for the observation that ideophones typically form an open lexical class, and uses insights from canonical typology to explore the larger typological space. According to the resulting definition, a canonical ideophone is a member of an open lexical class of marked words that depict sensory imagery. The five elements of this definition can be seen as dimensions that together generate a possibility space to characterise cross-linguistic diversity in depictive means of expression. This approach allows for the systematic comparative treatment of ideophones and ideophone-like phenomena. Some phenomena in the larger typological space are discussed to demonstrate the utility of the approach: phonaesthemes in European languages, specialised semantic classes in West-Chadic, diachronic diversions in Aslian, and depicting constructions in signed languages.

Methods: Five focus group discussions were conducted with 21 participants of Turkish-Dutch background. Participants were asked to discuss perceived differences between GP-patient encounters in the Netherlands and Turkey. Results: Our study revealed that Turkish-Dutch patients regularly expect Dutch GPs to show other behavior than they perceive to obtain on two themes, 1) dealing with patients' symptoms and 2) communication. In general, Turkish-Dutch patients expect Dutch GPs to show faster, more decisive and informative behavior in diagnostics and treatment. These expectations seem based on their experiences with practitioners in Turkey and on differences between health care systems. Conclusions: GP-patient difficulties appear primarily the result of underlying frustrations rather than clashes resulting from differences in explanatory models of illness or cultural values. Practice implications: Whereas systemic differences are more difficult to alter, difficulties in the communication are more readily amenable to change. Patient-centered communication and information about the reasons for being restrictive in diagnosing and treating on symptoms could alleviate these frustrations.

In the (psycho)linguistics literature we find linguistic animacy dichotomies which are (implicitly) assumed to correspond to biological dichotomies. We argue this is problematic, as it leaves us without a cognitively grounded, universal description for non-prototypical cases. We show that 'animacy' in language can be better understood as universally emerging from a gradual, cognitive property by collecting animacy ratings for a great range of nouns from Japanese and Persian. We used these cognitive ratings in turn to predict linguistic variation in these languages traditionally explained through dichotomous distinctions. We show that whilst (speakers of) languages may subtly differ in their conceptualisation of animacy, universality may be found in the process of mapping conceptual animacy to linguistic variation.

However, the implementation of interdisciplinary learning in medical education is challenging. The present study deepens the understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent to the implementation of an interdisciplinary course. We elucidated the attitudes and beliefs of students participating in a newly developed interdisciplinary minor, in which students of medicine (MS) and communication and information sciences (CISS) were involved.MethodsWe conducted four semi-structured focus group interviews, of which two were held before, and two were held after the course. Seven MS and six CISS participated voluntarily. A pre-arranged interview guide was used. The interviews were recorded and afterwards systematically analyzed with the 'constant comparative analysis' technique.ResultsThe focus group interviews revealed three differences in epistemics between students in terms of 1) curriculum content, 2) educational formats and 3) student's competence perceptions. These factors influenced the way students evaluated themselves, each other and the interdisciplinary course.ConclusionsWe conclude that factors that influence interdisciplinary learning are personal epistemics, individual learning preferences, and the synergy that is achieved throughout interdisciplinary learning. Organizing the dialogue among students of different disciplines could make students aware of inequalities, implicated biases and assigned status of different student groups. These empirical results are crucial to tailor interdisciplinary education to each specific discipline and to take interdisciplinary learning to a higher level of maturity.

The new descriptors cover goal-oriented online transactions, including written correspondence and the use of formulaic language. In Dutch business schools, students learn German for special purposes at B1/2 level: they are expected to master German in a professional context well enough to facilitate interactions and transactions. The question is how their not always flawless attempts at inviting a German colleague to a meeting are received by L1 language users. Is the level of B1/2 German sufficient to avoid bothersome situations? Is these learners' mastery at B1/2 level sufficient to maintain a good relationship with a German partner? This study investigated whether communicative clashes might occur because of flawed German language use. Ninety-eight German business professionals, all L1 speakers of German, were asked to rate pragma-linguistic infelicities and syntactic, lexical and morphological errors in 16 business e-mails written by Dutch learners of German, using a 7-point Likert scale. The results showed that pragma-linguistic infelicities were considered more bothersome than syntactic, lexical or morphological errors, which suggests that L2 German writing courses should raise more explicit awareness of pragma-linguistic forces in intercultural communication. This idea is in line with recommendations contained in the new Companion Volume. Furthermore, it was studied whether knowledge of the writer's foreign provenance and Dutch nationality affected the judgement of the German professionals. This was not the case.

The role of grammar in spelling homophonous regular verbs	WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LITERACY			English	Article						verb spelling errors; grammar; homophony; frequency effect; 11-18 year high school pupils; Dutch	FULL-FORM; FREQUENCY; DOMINANCE; WORD	Can a lack of grammatical knowledge alone be held accountable for the spelling errors that are made for homophonous verb forms and do these errors occur because spellers do not apply their grammatical knowledge? Three experiments with secondary school pupils were conducted on Dutch weak prefix verbs. The results confirmed that pupils made many spelling errors and also have great problems identifying the verb forms' functions. Moreover, a direct correlation was revealed between a pupil's identification of the form's grammatical function and its spelling. These results indicate that many errors result from pupils' inability to determine the grammatical functions of the forms. If pupils know the form's function, they are more likely to also spell the form correctly. If they do not, they often choose the form's homophone, especially if the homophone is more frequent than the target form. Spelling education thus needs a strong grammatical basis.

MA-EM: A neurocognitive model for understanding mixed and ambiguous emotions and morality	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion; morality; narratives; language; ambiguity	MENTAL SIMULATION; LANGUAGE; ENTERTAINMENT; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; NARRATIVES; FICTION; SYSTEMS; VIRTUE; FMRI	Understanding emotions and moral intentions of other people is integral to being human. Humanities scholars have long recognized the complex and ambiguous nature of emotions and morality. People are rarely 'just' happy, or sad. Neither are they 'just' good or bad people. Despite this, most knowledge about the psychological and neural basis of emotions and moral understanding comes from experiments investigating unidimensional and non-ambiguous emotions and morality. The goal of this paper is twofold. First I want to point out why mixed and ambiguous emotions and morality are a promising research topic for cognitive neuroscientists. Observing or experiencing mixed or ambiguous emotions and morality tends to have a strong impact on humans. This impact is clearly visible in narratives and fiction, and I will argue that narratives make an excellent stimulus to study the effects of emotional and moral ambiguity. Second, I will sketch a model to help guide research in this promising corner of human cognition.

J	de Vos, M				de Vos, Machteld			In Between Description and Prescription: Analysing Metalanguage in Normative Works on Dutch 1550-1650	LANGUAGES			English	Article						standardisation; codification; language norms; language ideologies; arguments; early modernity; Dutch; prescription; description	LANGUAGE; DIALECT	This paper is the first to perform a systematic quantitative analysis of the arguments used to motivate selections in grammatical entries from normative works on Standard Dutch written between ca. 1550 and 1650. Thus, it aims to obtain insight into what language ideologies were characteristic of this early modern period, what these reveal about how Standard Dutch took shape in its initiating phase, and what the differences are between the codification of Dutch in the early modern period (16th/17th century) and the (post)modern period (20th/21st century; analysed in earlier studies). Although certain issues within the annotation method need to be addressed in future research, the results indicate that the following principles were particularly characteristic of the early modern period: for Dutch to be a good language in terms of its grammar, it ought to differentiate, display consistency, mirror Latin and Greek, and reflect the use of certain authorities. These linguistic principles form the roots of the part of the Dutch standard language ideology (SLI; which, as previous research has shown, came into existence in the decades around 1800) that connects 'language' with 'norm' and that bestows value on the language's regularity. However, the additional connection to social identity, that forms a second and crucial part of the SLI, played no major part in the arguments used in this time period yet. Moreover, two important differences between the early modern period and the (post)modern period were found: (1) the latter period showed a higher degree of consensus and therefore of canonisation of the normative discourse than the former period; (2) the nature of the metalanguage used in normative publications was explicitly prescriptive in the later period but mostly ostensibly descriptive/implicitly prescriptive in the earlier period. This indicates that, in terms of the metalanguage used, the normative discourse in the formative period of Standard Dutch was in between description and prescription.

J	Hogeweg, L; Vicente, A				Hogeweg, Lotte; Vicente, Agustin			On the nature of the lexicon: The status of rich lexical meanings	JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS			English	Article						lexical semantics; polysemy; coercion; rich versus thin meanings; semantic versus conceptual knowledge	POLYSEMY; COPREDICATION; COMPREHENSION	Both in linguistics and in psycholinguistics there is some debate about how rich or thin lexico-semantic representations are. Traditionally, in formal semantics but also in philosophy of language as well as in cognitive pragmatics, lexical meanings have been thought to be simple stable denotations or functions. In this paper, we present and discuss a number of interpretational phenomena of which the analysis proposed in the literature makes crucial use of rich meanings. The phenomena in question are cases where the assignment of truth-conditional contents to utterances seems to follow rules that do not operate on simple stable denotations or any other kind of 'thin' meanings but where composition takes rich structured representations as input. We also discuss problems for such accounts, which are mostly based on the inability of extant rich meanings accounts to explain many other interpretational phenomena, and we discuss the solutions that have been proposed to solve them. Furthermore, we address the discussion whether the informationally rich meanings are part of semantics, and more specifically part of the lexicon, or whether this information should be ascribed to more general world knowledge.

Clinical evidence vs preliminary speculation in newspaper coverage of diabetes innovations: a quantitative analysis	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health journalism; Information behavior; Diabetes; Medical innovations; Evidence-based practice	JOURNALISM	Objectives: Researchers have discussed that journalistic reporting of medical developments is often characterised by exaggeration or lack of context, but additional quantitative evidence to support this claim is needed. This study introduces a quantitative approach to assessing coverage of medical innovations, by aiming at provided references to observed clinical effects. Although observed clinical effects reflect increased chances for future medical applications, it is unknown to which extent newspaper articles refer to it when spreading health information. We aimed to assess, over a 6-year period, newspaper publication characteristics of diabetes innovations, arising from all scientific areas of interest, regarding the total count and the proportion of articles that provide references to demonstrated clinical efficacy. Study design: Quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles covering innovative treatments for diabetes. Methods: We performed a systematic review of newspaper articles between 2011 and 2016 printed in the largest six Dutch newspapers. By assessing in-article references, it was possible to quickly distinguish between (1) articles that referred to actual clinical efficacy demonstrated in a scientific setting and (2) articles that presented either predictions, fundamental research, preclinical research or personal experiences and recommendations. Proportion differences between scientific areas of interest were analysed using the chi-squared test. Results: A total of 613 articles were categorised. Total newspaper publication frequency increased with 9.9 articles per year (P = .031). In total, 17% of the articles contained a reference to any proven clinical efficacy. Articles about human nutrition science (7%; P = .001) and (neuro) psychology (4.3%; P = .014) less frequently provided a reference to actual clinical efficacy. Conclusions: Our findings show that less than one in five newspaper articles about diabetes research contains a reference to relevant clinical effects, while the publication count is increasing. These statistics may contribute to feelings of false hope and confusion in patients. (C) 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sanders, J; de Vries, R; Besseling, S; Nieuwenhuijze, M				Sanders, Jose; de Vries, Raymond; Besseling, Susanne; Nieuwenhuijze, Marianne			'Such a waste' - conflicting communicative roles of Dutch midwifery students in childbirth decision making	MIDWIFERY			English	Article						Informed decision making; Midwifery education; Health communication; Media influence; Place of birth; Pain relief	MIDWIVES; WOMEN; CARE; PREGNANCY; EDUCATION; BIRTH; LABOR	Objective: In the Netherlands, the place of birth, birthing position, and pain relief are subject to preference-sensitive decisions of women, after counseling by their midwife. Dutch midwives are responsible for providing information and advice to guide pregnant women in such decisions. In this study we investigate how midwifery students, who are simultaneously committed to midwifery values and influenced by media culture, approach such preference-oriented communication in midwifery care. Design and setting: In-depth interviews and a focus group with seventeen Dutch midwifery students were conducted and analyzed applying a grounded theory approach. Findings: Student midwives are confronted with women who prefer a medical ("safe") and pain-free ("comfortable") birth. Such preferences reveal culturally induced priorities that form a threat to the bond of trust between midwives and women throughout the childbirth continuum. This development is felt personally by midwifery students, as an impact on each individual physiological birth, as well as professionally, as a threat to the midwifery values they acquire in their education. The interviews revealed that students have adopted distinctive communicative strategies to respond to media-driven values in childbearing women: Take Time and Listen; Counsel Neutral Information; and Safeguard from Negative Impact. Key conclusions and implications: Non-confrontational communication strategies allow midwifery students to build a trusting relationship with women, but the strategies are in part contradictory. Students experience inner tension due to decision outcomes that conflict with their midwifery values. Consequences for midwifery education are discussed.

We present the results of five studies that evaluated the impact of five forms of exposure to fiction. These included the effects of recalling reading fiction, of being prescribed fiction, of discussing fiction relative to non-fiction, and of discussing literary fiction relative to best-seller fiction. The first three studies directly recruited participants; the final two relied on scraped social media data from Reddit and Twitter. Results show that fiction can have a positive impact on measures of mood and emotion, but that a process of mnemonic or cognitive consolidation is required first: exposure to fiction does not, on its own, have an immediate impact on well-being.

An understanding of the intelligibility level of the patient's dysarthric speech can provide an insight into the progression/status of the underlying cause and is essential for planning therapy. Automatic assessment of dysarthric speech intelligibility can be of immense value and serve to assist speech language pathologists in diagnosis and therapy. However, this is a non-trivial problem due to the high intra and inter speaker variability in dysarthric speech. In this article we propose a machine learning-based method to automatically classify dysarthric speech into intelligible (I) and non-intelligible (NI) using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) Networks. We explored balancing of training data to represent both the classes almost equally and its implications on the binary classification. Additionally, we present a mechanism to use the available pre-trained acoustic models for transfer-learning. It was observed that the transfer learning method was able to handle channel noise. This technique provided significant improvement of roughly 6% as compared to traditional machine learning method.

We predicted that the model less accurately reconstructs children's speech productions as they grow older because children gradually begin to generate speech using abstracted forms rather than specific "chunks" from their speech environment. To test this idea, we trained the model on both recently encountered and cumulative speech input from a longitudinal child language corpus. We then assessed whether the model could accurately reconstruct children's speech. Controlling for utterance length and the presence of duplicate chunks, we found no evidence that the CBL becomes less accurate in its ability to reconstruct children's speech with age.

Longitudinal data were acquired from a sample of 133 students. Using three different mediation analyses, the study demonstrated significant medium-sized effects of English reading proficiency on students' grade point average (GPA) by the end of year 1 and a small but significant indirect relationship between reading proficiency and the final GPA scores by the end of year 4, mediated by the GPA scores after year 1. These findings show that the academic English reading proficiency of students in a non-western multilingual academic context is important for their academic achievement. It also found that academic results obtained by students in their first-year at University were a sound predictor for success at the end of their studies. Results from this study confirm the need for universities in multilingual settings to invest in L2 students' English reading proficiency at the start of their academic programs. Instructional recommendations are made, along with suggestions for further study.

Prior research suggests that such mediated form-meaning associations become less dependent on keywords after retrieval practice. The present study investigated if retrieval-induced decreases in mediator use predict word retention. Thirty participants learned novel vocabulary using experimenter-provided keywords and repeatedly retrieved the words from memory while thinking aloud. As expected, keyword use decreased with practice: learners stopped mentioning keywords for 21.6% of the words (on average after 8.27 retrievals). Shifting to direct, unmediated retrieval predicted higher form and meaning recall on a retention test after 6-8 days. Continuing retrieval practice until a shift has occurred to direct retrieval thus seems beneficial for retention.

What strategies do LX speakers, in casu Spanish speakers of English, use as a function of situational context? What role do individual differences play? Methodology: This within-speaker study compares Spanish second-language English speakers' communication strategy use in an informal, peer-to-peer conversation and a formal interview. Data and analysis: The 15 hours of informal and 9.5 hours of formal speech from the Nijmegen Corpus of Spanish English were coded for 19 different communication strategies. Findings/conclusions: Overall, speakers prefer self-reliant strategies, which allow them to continue communication without their interlocutor's help. Of the self-reliant strategies, least effort strategies such as code-switching are used more often in informal speech, whereas relatively more effortful strategies (e.g. reformulations) are used more in informal speech, when the need to be unambiguously understood is felt as more important. Individual differences played a role: some speakers were more affected by a change in formality than others. Originality: Sensitivity to register variation has not yet been studied within communicative strategy use. Implications: General principles of communication govern speakers' strategy selection, notably the protection of positive face and the least effort and cooperative principles.

It was hypothesized that sentence recognition improves with the presence of iconic co-speech gestures and with foreign compared to native babble. Method: Thirty-two native Dutch participants performed a Dutch word recognition task in context in which they were presented with videos in which an actress uttered short Dutch sentences (e.g., Ze begint te openen, "She starts to open"). Participants were presented with a total of six audiovisual conditions: no background noise (i.e., clear condition) without gesture, no background noise with gesture, French babble without gesture, French babble with gesture, Dutch babble without gesture, and Dutch babble with gesture; and they were asked to type down what was said by the Dutch actress. The accurate identification of the action verbs at the end of the target sentences was measured. Results: The results demonstrated that performance on the task was better in the gesture compared to the nongesture conditions (i.e., gesture enhancement effect). In addition, performance was better in French babble than in Dutch babble. Conclusions: Listeners benefit from iconic co-speech gestures during communication and from foreign background speech compared to native. These insights into multimodal communication may be valuable to everyone who engages in multimodal communication and especially to a public who often works in public places where competing speech is present in the background.

The Influence of Learning to Read on the Recognition of Faces	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						reading; face perception; literacy; neuroimaging; open data; open materials		Written language, a human cultural invention, is far too recent a development for dedicated neural infrastructure to have evolved in its service. Newly acquired cultural skills, such as reading, thus recycle evolutionarily older circuits that originally evolved for different, but similar, functions (e.g., visual object recognition). The destructive-competition hypothesis predicts that this neuronal recycling has detrimental behavioral effects on the cognitive functions for which a cortical network originally evolved. In a study with 97 literate, low-literate, and illiterate participants from the same socioeconomic background, we found that even after adjusting for cognitive ability and test-taking familiarity, learning to read was associated with an increase, rather than a decrease, in object-recognition abilities. These results are incompatible with the claim that neuronal recycling results in destructive competition and are consistent with the possibility that learning to read instead fine-tunes general object-recognition mechanisms, a hypothesis that needs further neuroscientific investigation.

We investigate whether such a model can be used to recognise words by embedding isolated words and using them to retrieve images of their visual referents. We investigate the time-course of word recognition using a gating paradigm and perform a statistical analysis to see whether well known word competition effects in human speech processing influence word recognition. Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise words, and the gating paradigm reveals that words can be recognised from partial input as well and that recognition is negatively influenced by word competition from the word initial cohort.

Target items were presented in two types of nonword contexts to examine the effects of stimulus list composition and language background. We found similar negative brain responses for regularly and irregularly inflected words, and for productively and non-productively derived words, in the 200-350 ms time window for both participant groups. In the 350-500 ms time window, most negative brain responses were observed for the irregularly inflected verbs. We suggest that the negativities found in the 200-350 ms time window reflect early, form-based processing of complex words. In the 350-500 ms time window, this processing is affected by a discrepancy between orthography and morphology. Different results for the Dutch and Turkish Dutch speakers in the nonword contexts show that, due to their language background, decomposition is more automatized in Turkish-Dutch speakers. Their processing strategy is thus less affected by the manipulation of stimulus list composition. In contrast, decomposition in our Dutch speakers is less automatized and thus more sensitive to the structure of nonwords.

J	Ostarek, M; Huettig, F				Ostarek, Markus; Huettig, Falk			Six Challenges for Embodiment Research	CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						embodiment; cognition; language; conceptual processing	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; VISUAL PROCESSES; INTERFERENCE; OBJECTS; WORDS	Twenty years after Barsalou's seminal perceptual-symbols article, embodied cognition, the notion that cognition involves simulations of sensory, motor, or affective states, has moved from an outlandish proposal to a mainstream position adopted by many researchers in the psychological and cognitive sciences (and neurosciences). Though it has generated productive work in the cognitive sciences as a whole, it has had a particularly strong impact on research into language comprehension. The view of a mental lexicon based on symbolic word representations, which are arbitrarily linked to sensory aspects of their referents, was generally accepted since the cognitive revolution in the 1950s. This has radically changed. Given the current status of embodiment as a main theory of cognition, it is somewhat surprising that a close look at the literature reveals that the debate about the nature of the processes involved in language comprehension is far from settled, and key questions remain unanswered. We present several suggestions for a productive way forward.

Vowel reduction is a strong cue to lexical stress in English but not Dutch. Native English listeners and Dutch second-language learners of English completed a cue-weighting stress perception experiment. Participants heard sentence-final pitch-accented auditory stimuli and identified them as DEsert (initial stress) or deSSERT (final stress). The stimuli were manipulated in seven steps from initial to final stress, manipulating two dimensions at a time: vowel quality and pitch, vowel quality and duration, and pitch and duration (other dimensions neutralized). Dutch listeners relied less on vowel quality and more on pitch than English listeners, with Dutch listeners' sensitivity to vowel quality increasing with English proficiency but their sensitivity to pitch not varying with proficiency; Dutch listeners evidenced similar or weaker reliance on duration than did English listeners, and their sensitivity to duration increased with proficiency; and Dutch listeners' use of pitch and duration were positively related. These results provide general support for a cue-based transfer approach to the perception of lexical stress.

Results showed that at least one phoneme was absent in 80.7% of the 291 noun tokens in the dataset, and that the whole cluster was absent (e.g., [mis] for ministre) in no less than 15.5% of the tokens. Wedemonstrate that phonemes are not always completely absent, but that they may leave traces on neighbouring phonemes. Further, the clusters display undocumented voice assimilation patterns. Statistical modelling showed that a phoneme is most likely to be absent if the following phoneme is also absent. The durations of the phonemes are conditioned particularly by the position of the word in the prosodic phrase. We argue, on the basis of three different types of evidence, that in French word-final OLS clusters, the absence of obstruents is mainly due to gradient reduction processes, whereas the absence of schwa and liquids may also be due to categorical deletion processes.

J	De Troij, R; Van de Velde, F				De Troij, Robbert; Van de Velde, Freek			Beyond Mere Text Frequency: Assessing Subtle Grammaticalization by Different Quantitative Measures. A Case Study on the Dutch <i>Soort</i> Construction	LANGUAGES			English	Article						grammaticalization; SKT construction; binominals; dispersion		Grammaticalization has proven to be an insightful approach to semantic-morphosyntactic change within and across languages. Many studies, however, rely on assessing the large, obvious differences before and after the change. When investigating burgeoning or ongoing grammaticalization processes, it is notably harder to objectively measure the degree of grammaticalization. One approach is to gauge changes in the well-known 'parameters' of Lehmann, Hopper, and Himmelmann, but this approach is often qualitatively oriented. Quantitative studies mainly rely either on token frequency of a construction, assuming that grammaticalization is accompanied by a frequency increase, or by tracing the development of two competing constructions, looking at the proportion of their respective token frequencies. In this article, we argue for a wider range of quantitative measures, beyond token frequency, as dependent variables. We will show that these measures can jointly point to subtle ongoing grammaticalization. As a case study, we will focus on Dutch binominals with soort 'sort', a core member of the much-discussed sort-kind-type (SKT) construction in the languages of Europe. Based on a large dataset of over 14,000 instances from the period between 1850 and 1999, we investigate quantitatively measurable changes in the construction's surface behavior (i.e., the gradual loss of the relator van 'of' and increasing restrictions on premodification and pluralization, pointing to a process of 'decategorialization'). In addition, we will also use Gries's deviation of proportions (DP) to gauge the dispersion of soort, a valuable but under-used metric in quantitative studies of grammaticalization.

How formality affects non-native speech has rarely been studied. We investigated register variation by Spanish users of English by comparing formal and informal speech from the Nijmegen Corpus of Spanish English that we created. This corpus comprises speech from 34 Spanish speakers of English in interaction with Dutch confederates in two speech situations. Formality affected the amount of laughter and overlapping speech and the number of Spanish words. Moreover, formal speech had a more informational character than informal speech. We discuss how our findings relate to register variation in Spanish.

Foreign-accented speech affects decision-making processes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LANGUAGE; ATTITUDES; STRENGTH; FLUENCY; DIALECT; SPEAKER	Does listening to a foreign-accented speaker bias native speakers' behavior? We investigated whether the accent, i.e., a foreign accent versus a native accent, in which a social norm is presented affects native speakers' decision to respect the norm (Experiments 1 and 2) and the judgement for not respecting it (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we presented 128 native Spanish speakers with new social norms, adapted from the measures imposed by the Spanish Government to fight the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g., 'To avoid the spread of the Covid-19 virus, keep your distance'), whereas in Experiment 2, we presented 240 native Spanish speakers with everyday social norms learned from childhood (e.g., 'Not littering on the street or in public places'), that have an intrinsic cultural and linguistic link. In Experiment 1, the norms were uttered either in a native accent, or in a foreign accent unfamiliar to our participants to avoid stereotypes. In Experiment 2, we added an accent negatively perceived in Spain to assess the role of language attitudes on decision making. Overall, accent did not directly impact participants' final decisions, but it influenced the decision-making process. The factors that seem to underlie this effect are emotionality and language attitudes. These findings add up to the recent Foreign Accent effect observed on moral judgements and further highlight the role of the speaker's identity in decision making.

Experiment 1 (N = 120, 48 male) was a conceptual replication of a previous eye-tracking study that had not found evidence of a male bias. The results of the current eye-tracking experiment showed the generically-intended masculine pronoun to trigger a gender inference and cause a male bias, but for male participants and in stereotypically neutral stereotype contexts only. No evidence for a male bias was thus found in stereotypically female and male context nor for female participants altogether. Experiment 2 (N = 80, 40 male) used the same stimuli as Experiment 1, but employed the sentence evaluation paradigm. No evidence of a male bias was found in Experiment 2. Taken together, the results suggest that the generically-intended masculine pronoun zijn 'his' can cause a male bias for male participants even when the referents are previously introduced by inclusive and grammatically gender-unmarked iedereen 'everyone'. This male bias surfaces with eye-tracking, which taps directly into early language processing, but not in offline sentence evaluations. Furthermore, the results suggest that the intended generic reading of the masculine possessive pronoun zijn 'his' is more readily available for women than for men.

This study investigates whether listeners rely on their experience with reduced word pronunciation variants during the processing of single segment reduction. We tested three groups of listeners in a lexical decision experiment with French words produced either with or without word-medial schwa (e.g., /Revy/ and /Revy/ for revue). Participants also rated the relative frequencies of the two pronunciation variants of the words. If the recognition accuracy and reaction times (RTs) for a given listener group correlate best with the frequencies of occurrence holding for that given listener group, recognition is influenced by listeners' exposure to these variants. Native listeners' relative frequency ratings correlated well with their accuracy scores and RTs. Dutch advanced learners' accuracy scores and RTs were best predicted by their own ratings. In contrast, the accuracy and RTs from Dutch beginner learners of French could not be predicted by any relative frequency rating; the rating task was probably too difficult for them. The participant groups showed behaviour reflecting their difference in experience with the pronunciation variants. Our results strongly suggest that listeners store the frequencies of occurrence of pronunciation variants, and consequently the variants themselves.

Here we critically review theory and empirical findings in this domain. We distinguish local learning enhancement (where the iconicity of certain lexical items influences the learning of those items) and general learning enhancement (where the iconicity of certain lexical items influences the later learning of non-iconic items or systems). We find that evidence for local learning enhancement is quite strong, though not as clear cut as it is often described and based on a limited sample of languages. Despite common claims about broader facilitatory effects of iconicity on learning, we find that current evidence for general learning enhancement is lacking. We suggest a number of productive avenues for future research and specify what types of evidence would be required to show a role for iconicity in general learning enhancement. We also review evidence for functions of iconicity beyond word learning: iconicity enhances comprehension by providing complementary representations, supports communication about sensory imagery, and expresses affective meanings. Even if learning benefits may be modest or cross-linguistically varied, on balance, iconicity emerges as a vital aspect of language.	[Nielsen, Alan K.

This study investigates the role of social distance between interlocutors. Twenty-five native Dutch speakers retold eight short films to confederates, who acted either formally or informally. Speakers were familiarized with the informal confederates, whereas the formal confederates remained strangers. Results show that the two types of interlocutors elicited different versions of the same stories. Formal interlocutors (i. e. large social distance) elicited lower articulation rates, and more nouns and prepositions, both indicators of explicit information. Speakers addressing the informal interlocutors, to whom social distance was small, however, provided more explicit information with an involved character (i. e. adjectives with subjective meanings). They also used the word and more often as a gap filler or as a way to keep the floor. Furthermore, a small social distance elicited more laughter, interjections, first-person pronouns and direct speech, which are all indicators of involvement, empathy and subjectivity.

Investigating Dutch teachers' beliefs on working with linguistic metaconcepts to improve students' L1 grammatical understanding	RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION			English	Article						Grammar teaching; teacher beliefs; linguistic metaconcepts; national survey; secondary education	KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; ENGLISH	L1 grammar teaching worldwide often takes the form of traditional grammar teaching with decontextualized parsing exercises and rules of thumb. Some researchers have proposed enriching such forms of grammar teaching by relating traditional grammatical concepts to underlying metaconcepts from linguistic theory. The merits of such an approach have become apparent in recent intervention studies, but the question remains how teachers perceive such forms of grammar teaching, which is of particular importance for curriculum development. The present study investigated Dutch teachers' beliefs in focus groups and a national survey (N= 127). It is found that Dutch language teachers see important benefits of a metaconceptual approach to grammar teaching, particularly as a means to improve students' grammatical understanding. However, results also indicate that while teachers may see clear pedagogical and conceptual advantages of working based on underlying metaconcepts, their own teaching practice appears to be much more traditional. This discrepancy is explained by assuming that contextual factors have a restraining effect on what teachers can or want to do in reality. Once such contextual factors no longer play a part, teachers' views tend to be much more geared towards a metaconceptual approach. The paper concludes with some implications for future research.

J	Hubers, F; Cucchiarini, C; Strik, H; Dijkstra, T				Hubers, Ferdy; Cucchiarini, Catia; Strik, Helmer; Dijkstra, Ton			Individual word activation and word frequency effects during the processing of opaque idiomatic expressions	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Idioms; priming; word naming; word frequency; form-meaning interaction	MEMORY; ACCESS	Idiom processing studies have paid considerable attention to the relationship between idiomatic expressions as a whole and their constituent words. Although most research focused on the semantic properties of the constituent words, their orthographic form could also play a role in processing. To test this, we assessed both form and meaning activation of individual words during the processing of opaque idioms. In two primed word naming experiments, Dutch native speakers silently read sentences word by word and then named the last word of the sentence. This target word was embedded in either an idiomatic or a literal context and was expected and correct in this context (COR), semantically related (REL) to the expected word, or unrelated (UNREL) to the expected word. The correct target word in the idiomatic context was always part of an opaque idiom. Faster naming latencies for the idiom-final noun than for the unrelated target in the idiomatic context indicated that the idiom was activated as a whole during processing. In addition, semantic facilitation was observed in the literal context (COR < REL < UNREL), but not in the idiomatic context (COR < REL = UNREL). This is evidence that the idiom-final noun was not activated at the meaning level of representation. However, an inhibitory effect of orthographic word frequency of the idiom-final noun indicated that the idiom-final noun was activated at the form level. These results provide evidence in favour of a hybrid model of idiom processing in which the individual words and the idiom as a whole interact on form and meaning levels of representation.

J	de Swart, P; van Bergen, G				de Swart, Peter; van Bergen, Geertje			How Animacy and Verbal Information Influence V2 Sentence Processing: Evidence from Eye Movements	OPEN LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Verb-initial sentences; predictive processing; visual world; Dutch; lexical information; selectional restrictions; argument structure; grammar-performance connection	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC ROLES; PREDICTION; ASSIGNMENT; WORDS; ERP	There exists a clear association between animacy and the grammatical function of transitive subject. The grammar of some languages require the transitive subject to be high in animacy, or at least higher than the object. A similar animacy preference has been observed in processing studies in languages without such a categorical animacy effect. This animacy preference has been mainly established in structures in which either one or both arguments are provided before the verb. Our goal was to establish (i) whether this preference can already be observed before any argument is provided, and (ii) whether this preference is mediated by verbal information. To this end we exploited the V2 property of Dutch which allows the verb to precede its arguments. Using a visual-world eye-tracking paradigm we presented participants with V2 structures with either an auxiliary (e.g. Gisteren heeft X. 'Yesterday, X has.') or a lexical main verb (e.g. Gisteren motiveerde X ... 'Yesterday, X motivated ...') and we measured looks to the animate referent. The results indicate that the animacy preference can already be observed before arguments are presented and that the selectional restrictions of the verb mediate this bias, but do not override it completely.

These predictions typically go untested, however, since psycholinguists have assumed that the temporal dynamics of the speech signal is a poor index of the temporal dynamics of the underlying speech planning process. This article argues that this problem is tractable, and presents and validates two simple metrics that derive planning unit onset and offset times from the acoustic signal and articulatographic data.

TEACHING VERB SPELLING THROUGH EXPLICIT DIRECT INSTRUCTION	L1 EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE			English	Article						verb spelling; spelling instruction; EDI; grammar; homophony	FREQUENCY; ORTHOGRAPHY; GRAMMAR; INQUIRY; WRITTEN; FORMS	Homophonous verb forms are notoriously difficult to spell. Two intervention studies - one with secondaryschool students and one with university students - compared the effectiveness of an Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) teaching approach that was very interactive with traditional instruction (TI) on Dutch homophonous verb spelling. The two approaches differ in the attention dedicated to the identification of the grammatical functions of verb forms and in the teacher's guidance of the students, which affects the interactivity during the classes. Students were pre-tested and post-tested on their knowledge of grammar and spelling of homophonous verb forms embedded in sentences. Both the EDI and the TI courses consisted of 4.5 hours of training. Secondary-school students' verb-spelling performance improved, irrespective of the type of instruction. University students' verb-spelling performance increased after both interventions, probably resulting from their improved grammatical knowledge. Importantly, the EDI students' performance increased more than the TI students' performance because the EDI students had learnt to rely more on their grammatical knowledge or make better use of their increased grammatical mastery. These results are in line with our hypothesis that the explicit interactivity that is inherent to EDI is beneficial for teaching verb spelling to students beyond primary-school level, who already possess some grammatical knowledge.

A diary study on literacy practices in Ghana	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN READING			English	Article							READING HABITS; EDUCATION; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS	Background This study explores the English literacy practices of students in Ghana, in particular their time spent on reading, the availability of reading resources and their use in the curriculum, and the importance of reading from the perspectives of students and lecturers. Methods Student diaries (6,364 reported hours) and interviews (12 students/ 14 lecturers) were used for data collection. Results Students spend many hours on academic work, but little time on processing academic texts. Their low reading proficiency is maintained at university due to the following factors: little time spent on reading, the type of reading students engage in, institutional values and poor resources. Conclusion Universal mechanisms that determine literacy practices from the more affluent Western world are prevalent in Ghana. These mechanisms, in combination with contextual factors, especially poor resources and low reading levels, make the Ghana case distinct.

In this paper, we propose that adversarial images should be evaluated based on semantic mismatch, rather than label mismatch, as used in current work. In other words, we propose that an image of a "mug" would be considered adversarial if classified as "turnip", but not as "cup", as current systems would assume. Our novel idea of taking semantic misclassification into account in the evaluation of adversarial images offers two benefits. First, it is a more realistic conceptualization of what makes an image adversarial, which is important in order to fully understand the implications of adversarial images for security and privacy. Second, it makes it possible to evaluate the transferability of adversarial images to a real-world classifier, without requiring the classifier's label set to have been available during the creation of the images. The paper carries out an evaluation of a transfer attack on a real-world image classifier that is made possible by our semantic misclassification approach. The attack reveals patterns in the semantics of adversarial misclassifications that could not be investigated using conventional label mismatch.

This paper concentrates on variations in the representation of subjective cognition and reasoning of subjects in the discourse. A corpus-based analysis was conducted that compared the domains of use of causal fragments in Dutch Bible translations that were either old, contemporary and loyal, or "easy". In a close comparison of Bible translations, differences between domains of use are analysed in more detail. In old translations, the character's subjective reasoning is clearly separated from the narrator's utterances. By contrast, in modern translations, causal reasoning is more intertwined between character and narrator, resulting in shared reasoning.

J	Hazebroek, BK; Croijmans, I				Hazebroek, Bente Klein; Croijmans, Ilja			Let's talk over coffee: Exploring the effect of coffee flavour descriptions on consumer imagery and behaviour	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Coffee; Flavour; Consumer behaviour; Imagery; Sensory marketing; Language	VISUAL-IMAGERY; FOOD CHOICE; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; TASTE; EMBODIMENT; SENSES; ROLES	Online, as offline, purchase decisions are based on expectations about flavour and taste, offering an opportunity to make healthy and sustainable options desirable by using the right descriptions. This study investigates the effect of different types of coffee flavour descriptions on consumers, showing language can influence consumer purchase behaviour. In two experiments, participants were asked to rate vividness of imagery, desire to taste, and willingness to pay for several coffee flavour descriptions online. In the first experiment, descriptions differed on the type of words used: abstract words ("sweet"), evaluative words ("nice"), source-based words ("berries"), or a combination of these. Word type had an effect on all three variables, with source-based terms leading to the most vivid imagery, highest desire to taste, and highest willingness to pay. In the second experiment, descriptions presented flavour words in different description contexts (a stative, sensory, or figurative description), or a simple summation of those 6 words. The results showed no difference between the different types of descriptions, but words in sentences led to higher imagery vividness, higher desire to taste, and higher willingness to pay. Together, this suggests consumers seem to be able to imagine flavour from a verbal description quite clearly, but it depends on the type of words used and the form in which these words are presented. The desire to taste and willingness to pay for a product relate to the degree of imageability. The results are not only useful for optimising (coffee) flavour descriptions, but also for shaping consumer choices.

J	Szuba, A; Redl, T; de Hoop, H				Szuba, Agnieszka; Redl, Theresa; de Hoop, Helen			Are Second Person Masculine Generics Easier to Process for Men than for Women? Evidence from Polish	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Masculine generics; Second person; Addressing; Gender marking mismatch	GRAMMATICAL GENDER; ERP EVIDENCE; LANGUAGE; CONTEXT; COMPREHENSION; INFORMATION; AGREEMENT; MUSICIANS; PRONOUNS; SPEAKER	In Polish, it is obligatory to mark feminine or masculine grammatical gender on second-person singular past tense verbs (e.g., Dostalas list 'You received-F a letter'). When the addressee's gender is unknown or unspecified, masculine but never feminine gender marking may be used. The present self-paced reading experiment aims to determine whether this practice creates a processing disadvantage for female addressees in such contexts. We further investigated how men process being addressed with feminine-marked verbs, which constitutes a pragmatic violation. To this end, we presented Polish native speakers with short narratives. Each narrative contained either a second-person singular past tense verb with masculine or feminine gender marking, or a gerund verb with no gender marking as a baseline. We hypothesised that both men and women would read the verbs with gender marking mismatching their own gender more slowly than the gender-unmarked gerund verbs. The results revealed that the gender-mismatching verbs were read equally fast as the gerund verbs, and that the verbs with gender marking matching participant gender were read faster. While the relatively high reading time of the gender-unmarked baseline was unexpected, the pattern of results nevertheless shows that verbs with masculine marking were more difficult to process for women compared to men, and vice versa. In conclusion, even though masculine gender marking in the second person is commonly used with a gender-unspecific intention, it created similar processing difficulties for women as the ones that men experienced when addressed through feminine gender marking. This study is the first one, as far as we are aware, to provide evidence for the male bias of second-person masculine generics during language processing.

J	Spätgens, T; Schoonen, R				Spatgens, Tessa; Schoonen, Rob			Individual differences in reading comprehension in monolingual and bilingual children: The influence of semantic priming during sentence reading	LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						Reading comprehension; Semantic network; Semantic priming; Bilingualism; Self-paced reading	WORD KNOWLEDGE; LEXICAL QUALITY; VOCABULARY; CONTEXT; MEMORY; 1ST; ASSOCIATION; SIZE	Group differences in semantic priming between young readers with different comprehension levels have been reported, with poor readers showing reduced or no context-independent semantic priming compared to normal readers. However, other studies have not been able to replicate these effects on an individual differences level, even though the spreading of semantic activation is hypothesized to play a role in the reading comprehension process. In the present study, we investigated whether priming during sentence reading, rather than single word priming, could be related to children's reading comprehension scores. A self-paced reading experiment involving both associated and non-associated, context-dependent (functional) and context-independent (categorical) semantic relations was administered to 137 Dutch monolingual and bilingual children. Delayed facilitative priming effects were observed for non-associated context-dependently and context-independently related word pairs, but these were not linked to individual differences in reading comprehension. Monolinguals and bilinguals showed similar performance on almost all language measures, including semantic priming and reading comprehension.

Many linguists distinguish between explicit and implicit attitudes towards language, but more often than not it remains unclear how these constructs are defined, and what their potential significance is for the study of language variation and change. The contributions to this issue address this question by critically reflecting on theory and methodology, by highlighting (and clarifying) the terminological confusion, and by showcasing new methods and tools. It is hoped that this special issue can inspire theoretical and methodological convergence in a notoriously fragmented field, so that attitude researchers can identify the underlying structure of language attitudes, and the theoretical significance of language evaluation to processes of language variation and change.

J	Stoffelsma, L				Stoffelsma, Lieke			From 'sheep' to 'amphibian': English vocabulary teaching strategies in South African township schools	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION			English	Article						vocabulary; vocabulary instruction; teaching strategies; L2 vocabulary development; South Africa; high-poverty schools	LANGUAGE; LEARNERS	Background: South African learners have performed consistently poorly in reading assessments. This paper addresses two key components in improving reading literacy: vocabulary development and teacher knowledge and skills required for quality vocabulary instruction. Aim: This small-scale exploratory study reports on the English vocabulary teaching strategies of eight Grade 3 teachers in South African township schools serving poor communities and their implementation of these strategies in practice. Setting: The Western Cape teachers taught English Home Language (HL) learners. The Eastern Cape teachers taught Xhosa HL and English First Additional Language (FAL) learners. Methods: Teacher interviews and classroom observations. Results: The teachers used a range of basic vocabulary teaching strategies that complied with evidence-based vocabulary teaching strategies identified in the literature. However, most of the strategies employed did not reach an advanced level of active learning in which students were challenged and took ownership of their own vocabulary learning. Results showed that especially the English FAL teachers relied heavily on their L1 for vocabulary instruction. Conclusion: Grade 3 teachers in South African schools that serve poor communities are capable of providing rich print exposure in their classrooms showing that schools can, to a certain extent, play a compensatory role for the limited literacy opportunities in homes of children from low socio-economic backgrounds. However, in order for the learners to develop a more durable, rich vocabulary their teachers would need to engage in more interactive and in-depth instruction. Implications for policy are discussed.

J	Zee, T; ten Bosch, L; Plag, I; Ernestus, M				Zee, Tim; ten Bosch, Louis; Plag, Ingo; Ernestus, Mirjam			Paradigmatic Relations Interact During the Production of Complex Words: Evidence From Variable Plurals in Dutch	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						morphology; phonetics; paradigms; reduction; inflection; Dutch; plural; variation	DURATION; MORPHOLOGY; ENGLISH; PREDICTABILITY; REDUNDANCY; REDUCTION; FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE; ANALOGY; NOUNS	A growing body of work in psycholinguistics suggests that morphological relations between word forms affect the processing of complex words. Previous studies have usually focused on a particular type of paradigmatic relation, for example the relation between paradigm members, or the relation between alternative forms filling a particular paradigm cell. However, potential interactions between different types of paradigmatic relations have remained relatively unexplored. This paper presents two corpus studies of variable plurals in Dutch to test hypotheses about potentially interacting paradigmatic effects. The first study shows that generalization across noun paradigms predicts the distribution of plural variants, and that this effect is diminished for paradigms in which the plural variants are more likely to have a strong representation in the mental lexicon. The second study demonstrates that the pronunciation of a target plural variant is affected by coactivation of the alternative variant, resulting in shorter segmental durations. This effect is dependent on the representational strength of the alternative plural variant. In sum, by exploring interactions between different types of paradigmatic relations, this paper provides evidence that storage of morphologically complex words may affect the role of generalization and coactivation during production.

Each word token in the corpus is annotated with the correct orthographical form, the associated lemma and the part of speech. The most frequent polysemous words have been annotated for word meaning, while all words in the lexicon that was derived from the BasiScript corpus have been annotated for corpus and subcorpora frequency, dispersion, length, family size, family frequency, orthographic neighborhood size, and orthographic neighborhood frequency. Images of the texts are available to researchers. The present article describes the corpus and presents a comparison of BasiScript with BasiLex (a Dutch corpus with texts primary school children are likely to read, completed in 2015) by means of frequency profiling.

How secondary school students may benefit from linguistic metaconcepts to reason about L1 grammatical problems	LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION			English	Article						L1 grammar teaching; linguistic metaconcepts; linguistic reasoning; comparative judgement; secondary education	EDUCATION	In L1 grammar teaching, teachers often struggle with the students' conceptual understanding of the subject matter. Frequently, students do not acquire an in-depth understanding of grammar, and they seem generally incapable of reasoning about grammatical problems. Some scholars have argued that an in-depth understanding of grammar requires making connections between concepts from traditional grammar and underlying metaconcepts from linguistic theory. In the current study, we evaluate an intervention aiming to do this, following up on a previous study that found a significant effect for such an approach in university students of Dutch Language and Literature (d = 0.62). In the current study, 119 Dutch secondary school students' grammatical reasonings (N = 684) were evaluated by language teachers, teacher educators and linguists pre and post intervention using comparative judgement. Results indicate that the intervention significantly boosted the students' ability to reason grammatically (d = 0.46), and that many students can reason based on linguistic metaconcepts. The study also shows that reasoning based on explicit underlying linguistic metaconcepts and on explicit concepts from traditional grammar is more favored by teachers and (educational) linguists than reasoning without explicit (meta)concepts. However, some students show signs of incomplete acquisition of the metaconcepts. The paper discusses explanations for this incomplete acquisition.	[van Rijt, Jimmy H.

Using visual world eye-tracking, we focused on predictive use of case-marking cues in verb-medial and verb-final sentences in Turkish with adult Turkish heritage speakers (N = 25) and Turkish monolingual speakers (N = 24). Heritage speakers predicted in verb-medial sentences (when verb-semantic and case-marking cues were available), but not in verb-final sentences (when only case-marking cues were available) while monolinguals predicted in both. Prediction skills of heritage speakers were modulated by their spoken language experience in Turkish and written language experience in both languages. Overall, these results strongly suggest that verb-semantic information is needed to scaffold the use of morphosyntactic cues for prediction in heritage speakers. The findings also support the notion that both spoken and written language experience play an important role in predictive spoken language processing.

We tested whether a masculine generic pronoun causes a male bias when used in generic statements-that is, in the absence of a specific referent. We tested two types of generic statements by varying conceptual number, hypothesizing that the pronoun zijn "his" was more likely to cause a male bias with a conceptually singular than a conceptually plural antecedent (e.g., Someone (conceptually singular)/Everyone (conceptually plural) with perfect pitch can tune his instrument quickly). We found male participants to exhibit a male bias but with the conceptually singular antecedent only. Female participants showed no signs of a male bias. The results show that the generically intended masculine pronoun zijn "his" leads to a male bias in conceptually singular generic contexts but that this further depends on participant gender.

We present an elaborate user evaluation study to determine human preferences in forum summarization and to create a reference data set. We showed long threads to ten different raters and asked them to create a summary by selecting the posts that they considered to be the most important for the thread. We study the agreement between human raters on the summarization task, and we show how multiple reference summaries can be combined to develop a successful model for automatic summarization. We found that although the inter-rater agreement for the summarization task was slight to fair, the automatic summarizer obtained reasonable results in terms of precision, recall, and ROUGE. Moreover, when human raters were asked to choose between the summary created by another human and the summary created by our model in a blind side-by-side comparison, they judged the model's summary equal to or better than the human summary in over half of the cases. This shows that even for a summarization task with low inter-rater agreement, a model can be trained that generates sensible summaries. In addition, we investigated the potential for personalized summarization. However, the results for the three raters involved in this experiment were inconclusive. We release the reference summaries as a publicly available dataset.

We combined insights from studies on child bilingualism and adult second language acquisition. Sentence structures showing partial overlap between languages were investigated (long passives), as well as structures with complete or no overlap (verb second and verb third sentences). We found evidence for syntactic co-activation of overlapping structures in the form of inhibition during listening. Syntactic, and possibly lexical, overlap between languages, and language dominance modulated effects. In particular, online cross-linguistic influence was visible only in the German-Dutch group. Furthermore, effects were most pronounced when structures partially overlapped and were absent in non-overlapping structures. Effects of online cross-linguistic influence became stronger the more German-dominant children were. Our results indicate that syntactic co-activation across languages affects sentence processing in bilingual children.

When students tackle grammatical problems: Exploring linguistic reasoning with linguistic metaconcepts in L1 grammar education	LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION			English	Article						L1 Grammar teaching; Linguistic metaconcepts; Linguistic reasoning; Grammatical concepts; Syntax; Explicit knowledge	KNOWLEDGE; INSTRUCTION	When teaching grammar, one of the biggest challenges teachers face is how to make their students achieve conceptual understanding. Some scholars have argued that metaconcepts from theoretical linguistics should be used to pedagogically and conceptually enrich traditional L1 grammar teaching, generating more opportunities for conceptual understanding. However, no empirical evidence exists to support this theoretical position. The current study is the first to explore the role of linguistic metaconcepts in the grammatical reasoning of university students of Dutch Language and Literature. Its goal was to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of students' grammatical conceptual knowledge and reasoning and to investigate whether students' reasoning benefits from an intervention that related linguistic metaconcepts to concepts from traditional grammar. Results indicate, among other things, that using explicit linguistic metaconcepts and explicit concepts from traditional grammar is a powerful contributor to the quality of students' grammatical reasoning. Moreover, the intervention significantly improved students' use of linguistic metaconcepts. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[van Rijt, Jimmy H.

This perspective on olfaction is reflected in how we think and talk about smells in the West, with odor imagery and odor language reported to be difficult. In the present study we demonstrate odor cognition is superior in odor-color synaesthesia, where there are additional sensory connections to odor concepts. Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which input in 1 modality leads to involuntary perceptual associations. Semantic accounts of synaesthesia posit synaesthetic associations are mediated by activation of inducing concepts. Therefore, synaesthetic associations may strengthen conceptual representations. To test this idea, we ran 6 odor-color synaesthetes and 17 matched controls on a battery of tasks exploring odor and color cognition. We found synaesthetes outperformed controls on tests of both odor and color discrimination, demonstrating for the first time enhanced perception in both the inducer (odor) and concurrent (color) modality. So, not only do synaesthetes have additional perceptual experiences in comparison to controls, their primary perceptual experience is also different. Finally, synaesthetes were more consistent and accurate at naming odors. We propose synaesthetic associations to odors strengthen odor concepts, making them more differentiated (facilitating odor discrimination) and easier to link with lexical representations (facilitating odor naming). In summary, we show for the first time that both odor language and perception is enhanced in people with synaesthetic associations to odors.

Among the four language skills, speaking is the most anxiety-provoking skill. We investigated the presence of FLSA in Indonesian vocational high school students and we tested whether web-based language learning might help to reduce speaking anxiety, in particular when the facility in question is equipped with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). A mixed methods research was employed to investigate FLSA in 573 vocational high school students. A subset of them (n = 167) was selected to participate in two ASR-based web-experiments usingand NovoLearning. We additionally interviewed 11 of the students who participated in these web-experiments and five English teachers. The results showed that students indicated a moderate-to-serious level of FLSA, that they evaluated the learning websites positively, and believed that web-based language learning could alleviate their speaking anxiety. The interviews revealed that students felt less anxious when speaking in front of the ASR-based websites compared to speaking to peers or people. In order to evaluate the real effectiveness of ASR-based learning websites, future studies should investigate actual improvement of learners' speaking skills over a longer period of time.

Consider this analogy: When walking, speed can be continuously increased, within limits, but to speed up further, humans must run. Are there multiple qualitatively distinct speech "gaits" that resemble walking and running? Or is control achieved by continuous modulation of a single gait? This study investigates these possibilities through simulations of a new connectionist computational model of the cognitive process of speech production, EPONA, that borrows from Dell, Burger, and Svec's (1997) model. The model has parameters that can be adjusted to fit the temporal characteristics of speech at different speaking rates. We trained the model on a corpus of disyllabic Dutch words produced at different speaking rates. During training, different clusters of parameter values (regimes) were identified for different speaking rates. In a 1-gait system, the regimes used to achieve fast and slow speech are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different. In a multiple gait system, there is no linear relationship between the parameter settings associated with each gait, resulting in an abrupt shift in parameter values to move from speaking slowly to speaking fast. After training, the model achieved good fits in all three speaking rates. The parameter settings associated with each speaking rate were not linearly related, suggesting the presence of cognitive gaits. Thus, we provide the first computationally explicit account of the ability to modulate the speech production system to achieve different speaking styles.

We present an acoustic and lexical analysis of emotional valence in spontaneous speech of older adults. Data was collected by recalling autobiographical memories through a word association task. Due to the complex and personal nature of memories, we propose a novel coding scheme for emotional valence. We explore acoustic properties of speech as well as the use of affective words to predict emotional valence expressed in autobiographical memories. Using mixed-effect regression modelling, we compared predictive models based on acoustic information only, lexical information only, or a combination of both. Results show that the combined model accounts for the highest proportion of explained variance, with the acoustic features accounting for a smaller share of the total variance than the lexical features. Several acoustic and lexical features predicted valence. As a first attempt at analyzing spontaneous emotional speech in older adults autobiographical memories, the study provides more insight in which acoustic features can be used to predict valence (automatically) in a more ecologically valid setting.

This study experimentally investigated this question by assessing what cognitive traits moderated responses to literary and less-literary fictional vignettes. Specifically, participants were exposed to two variants of a celebrated literary text, one altered so as to remove overtly literary elements. A moderation analysis was performed on responses with respect to three variables: need for cognition (NC); meaning in life (measured in two subscales, search for meaning [SM] and presence of meaning [PM]); and intentionality/mentalizing ability (IM). Results showed that SM moderated interpretive response to the textual variation, such that those with increasing scores on the SM scale were increasingly more likely to rate the literary vignettes as worthy of appreciation. This result, in turn, gave grounds for a second study that investigated the role played by cloze values in identifying a text as "literary." The latter study showed that the literary and less-literary vignettes exhibited significant differences in cloze values. Taken together, these studies suggest that differences in responsiveness to literary materials may well be driven by preexisting cognitive factors.

J	Richter, M; Van Hout, R				Richter, Michael; Van Hout, Roeland			Ranking Dutch intensifiers: a usage-based approach	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article						intensifiers; strength; information value; corpus linguistics		The present approach estimates the strength of intensifiers in Dutch by computing their information values in a language corpus, that is, contextual information content (Cohen Priva, 2008; Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2011) and Shannon Information (Shannon & Weaver, 1948), to respectively explain the use value and the expressive value of intensifiers when they intensify a predicative adjective. Conflicting strength values help in understanding the high number of intensifiers commonly available in particular languages and the constant need for adding new ones. Our approach underlines the relevance of two measures of information content (IC) for ranking intensifiers: (i) IC in context: the more combinatorial or transitional options an intensifier has, the higher its contextual information content and consequently its use value; and (ii) IC in relation to all alternative intensifiers: the higher the surprisal value that the occurrence of an intensifier evokes, the higher its expressive value. We shall investigate the validity of these two measures by researching a large corpus of Dutch tweets and shall test whether the values of these two measures can predict the stacking order in sequences of intensifiers.

Previous research with reading-impaired adults and healthy, low-proficiency adult and child learners suggests that reading skills are related to prediction in spoken language comprehension. Here, we investigated whether differences in literacy are also related to predictive spoken language processing in non-reading-impaired proficient adult readers with varying levels of literacy experience. Using the visual world paradigm enabled us to measure prediction based on syntactic cues in the spoken sentence, prior to the (predicted) target word. Literacy experience was found to be the strongest predictor of target anticipation, independent of general cognitive abilities. These findings suggest that (a) experience with written language can enhance syntactic prediction of spoken language in normal adult language users and (b) processing skills can be transferred to related tasks (from reading to listening) if the domains involve similar processes (e.g., predictive dependencies) and representations (e.g., syntactic).

We focus on users' repair strategies, typically used for maintaining communication in social interaction. We use an existing dataset consisting of 36 video-recordings of elderly people completing a lengthy health survey with a Pepper robot. Miscommunication was abundant in the data, with some types of repair being more common than others. These were mainly related to "hearing trouble" on the side of the robot, leading to participants' repeats and rephrasings. Interactional trouble was also found to escalate, with multiple repair initiations, sometimes leading to "second best answers". This appeared to be a strategy for participants to avoid repair in the service of progressivity. Overall, miscommunication and repair in these task-oriented human-robot interactions require substantial adaptation from the human.

A conceptual (non)replication of Luria (1976)	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Culture; Literacy; Visual perception; Visual illusions	LITERACY	Luria (Luria, Cognitive development: Its cultural and social foundations, Harvard University Press, 1976) famously observed that people who never learnt to read and write do not perceive visual illusions. We conducted a conceptual replication of the Luria study of the effect of literacy on the processing of visual illusions. We designed two carefully controlled experiments with 161 participants with varying literacy levels ranging from complete illiterates to high literates in Chennai, India. Accuracy and reaction time in the identification of visual shape and color illusions and the identification of appropriate control images were measured. Separate statistical analyses of Experiments 1 and 2 as well as pooled analyses of both experiments do not provide any support for the notion that literacy affects the perception of visual illusions. Our large sample, carefully controlled study strongly suggests that literacy does not meaningfully affect the identification of visual illusions and raises some questions about other reports of cultural effects on illusion perception.

A.; Franco, Karlien; van Hout, Roeland			Linking Linguistic and Geographic Distance in Four Semantic Domains: Computational Geo-Analyses of Internal and External Factors in a Dialect Continuum	FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						computational sociolinguistics; dialectometry; lexical variation; semantic variation; spatial analysis; mixed-effects regression; limburg	REGRESSION; LANGUAGE	Dialectometry studies patterns of linguistic variation through correlations between geographic and aggregate measures of linguistic distance. However, aggregating smooths out the role of semantic characteristics, which have been shown to affect the distribution of lexical variants across dialects. Furthermore, although dialectologists have always been well-aware of other variables like population size, isolation and socio-demographic features, these characteristics are generally only included in dialectometric analyses afterwards for further interpretation of the results rather than as explanatory variables. This study showcases linear mixed-effects modelling as a method that is able to incorporate both language-external and language-internal factors as explanatory variables of linguistic variation in the Limburgish dialect continuum in Belgium and the Netherlands. Covering four semantic domains that vary in their degree of basic vs. cultural vocabulary and their degree of standardization, the study models linguistic distances using a combination of external (e.g., geographic distance, separation by water, population size) and internal (semantic density, salience) sources of variation. The results show that both external and internal factors contribute to variation, but that the exact role of each individual factor differs across semantic domains. These findings highlight the need to incorporate language-internal factors in studies on variation, as well as a need for more comprehensive analysis tools to help better understand its patterns.

This may lead to hypercorrection, meaning that the prescribed form in one construction is extended to another one in which it is in fact prohibited by prescriptive grammar. We discuss two such cases in Dutch: the hypercorrect use of the comparative particle dan 'than' in equative constructions, and the hypercorrect use of the accusative pronoun hen 'them' for a dative object. In two experiments, high school students of three educational levels were tested on their use of these hypercorrect forms (n(exp1) = 162, n(exp2) = 159). Our results indicate an overall large amount of hypercorrection across all levels of education, including preuniversity level students who otherwise perform better in constructions targeted by prescriptive grammar rules. We conclude that while teaching prescriptive grammar rules to high school students seems to increase their use of correct forms in certain constructions, this comes at a cost of hypercorrection in others.

This is mainly due to the fact that traditional grammar education suggests that language consists of sentences which are well-formed according to a fixed prescriptive norm. However, language is messy (especially spoken language), and even the analysis of written language is often unclear and controversial. Students generally do not learn how to deal with the differences between the prescriptive norms taught at school, language in real language situations, and their own language intuitions. They are not taught how to develop a more reflective attitude to tackle ill-structured language issues. Such a reflective attitude could be stimulated by a pedagogical approach to grammar that addresses higher order cognitive thinking skills and teaches students how to consult language resources. In this paper we combine a cognitive learning model with a reflective development model into a pedagogical template aimed at stimulating both cognitive learning and reflective development.

It has also been argued that these mindreading abilities are the product of cultural, rather than biological, evolution. Taken together, these claims suggest that the evolution of language has played an important role in the cultural evolution of human social cognition. Here we present a new computational model which formalises the assumptions that underlie this hypothesis, in order to explore how language and mindreading interact through cultural evolution. This model treats communicative behaviour as an interplay between the context in which communication occurs, an agent's individual perspective on the world, and the agent's lexicon. However, each agent's perspective and lexicon are private mental representations, not directly observable to other agents. Learners are therefore confronted with the task of jointly inferring the lexicon and perspective of their cultural parent, based on their utterances in context. Simulation results show that given these assumptions, an informative lexicon evolves not just under a pressure to be successful at communicating, but also under a pressure for accurate perspective-inference. When such a lexicon evolves, agents become better at inferring others' perspectives; not because their innate ability to learn about perspectives changes, but because sharing a language (of the right type) with others helps them to do so.

However, crossed random effects may have more complex interrelationships than is generally assumed. This becomes clear when comparing first language (L1) and second language (L2) influences on proficiency in Dutch as a third language (L3). Using a large database of L3 speaking proficiency scores, we assessed the mutual dependency between the crossed random effects of the L1 and the L2. The results suggest independent and robust linguistic distance effects of the L1 and the L2: the smaller the linguistic distance to the L3, the higher the L3 proficiency, with the L2 effect being weaker than the L1 effect. Although a model that incorporates an additional L1-by-L2 random interaction effect fits the data best, this model still stipulates the relative importance of an independent L2 distance effect. We found that the L1 distance effect is robust against the L2 distance effect and that the L2 distance effect is robust against interactive effects. We discuss possible explanations for interactions between the L1 and the L2. Overall, the data support independent linguistic distance effects of both the L1 and the L2, besides L1-L2 interactions. We recommend that researchers compare the fit of their crossed random effects models with the fit of models that also include the respective interaction effects.

We hypothesize that showing disclosure when asking questions can elicit reciprocity of self-disclosure by the users. We define two types of disclosure: self-disclosure and other-disclosure. Self-disclosure is sharing thoughts, feelings and information about oneself, whereas other-disclosure is sharing information about others and opinions of others. We analyzed 122 answers to the voicebot's disclosure and control questions by annotating the number of self-disclosure statements in the answers. We found no significant effect of asking disclosure questions on the number of self-disclosure statements. However, we did find a positive effect of asking disclosure questions on common markers of reciprocity such as the number of words, topic phrases, and first-person pronouns. Replication of this study with more participants would strengthen the validity of the findings.

J	Bazzi, L; Brouwer, S; Foucart, A				Bazzi, Luca; Brouwer, Susanne; Foucart, Alice			The impact of foreign accent on irony and its consequences on social interaction	JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Foreign-accented speech; pragmatic processing; speaker's identity; irony	LANGUAGE; SPEAKER	Literature has shown that foreign-accented (FA) speech modulates the degree of irony perceived by native (NA) individuals, but the subsequent consequences it may have on social interaction are unknown. To address this question, we presented Spanish first language (L1) users with written contexts with ironic/literal praises allocated to either a NA or a FA speaker. Written modality was used to avoid disfluency and to examine the impact of expectations of non-L1 comprehension on irony processing. For each of the 104 contexts, participants had to (1) assess the degree of irony of the speaker's praise inserted in the context, (2) assess the speaker's level of friendliness and (3) indicate the level of correctness of the response given to the ironic/literal comment. Results indicate that the speaker's identity modulates the degree of perceived irony as well as the perceived appropriateness of the responses given to ironic comments, even when the accent is not experienced. The theory proposed to account for the findings is that the expectation one has of a foreign individual's speech affects language processing that leads to misinterpretations, which may, consequently, deteriorate social interaction between L1 and LX users.

J	Favier, S; Huettig, F				Favier, Saoradh; Huettig, Falk			Long-term written language experience affects grammaticality judgements and usage but not priming of spoken sentences	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Literacy; grammaticality judgements; long-term syntactic priming	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NATIVE SPEAKERS; LEXICAL BOOST; LITERACY; PERSISTENCE; COMPREHENSION; ACQUISITION; ILLITERATE; VOCABULARY; FREQUENCY	"Book language" offers a richer linguistic experience than typical conversational speech in terms of its syntactic properties. Here, we investigated the role of long-term syntactic experience on syntactic knowledge and processing. In a preregistered study with 161 adult native Dutch speakers with varying levels of literacy, we assessed the contribution of individual differences in written language experience to offline and online syntactic processes. Offline syntactic knowledge was assessed as accuracy in an auditory grammaticality judgement task in which we tested violations of four Dutch grammatical norms. Online syntactic processing was indexed by syntactic priming of the Dutch dative alternation, using a comprehension-to-production priming paradigm with auditory presentation. Controlling for the contribution of nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal working memory, and processing speed, we observed a robust effect of literacy experience on the detection of grammatical norm violations in spoken sentences, suggesting that exposure to the syntactic complexity and diversity of written language has specific benefits for general (modality-independent) syntactic knowledge. We replicated previous results by finding robust comprehension-to-production structural priming, both with and without lexical overlap between prime and target. Although literacy experience affected the usage of syntactic alternates in our large sample, it did not modulate their priming. We conclude that amount of experience with written language increases explicit awareness of grammatical norm violations and changes the usage of (prepositional-object [PO] vs. double-object [DO]) dative spoken sentences but has no detectable effect on their implicit syntactic priming in proficient language users. These findings constrain theories about the effect of long-term experience on syntactic processing.

J	van de Ven, M; Ernestus, M				van de Ven, Marco; Ernestus, Mirjam			The role of segmental and durational cues in the processing of reduced words	LANGUAGE AND SPEECH			English	Article						Acoustic reduction; word recognition; speech perception; gating; phonetic detail	RECOGNITION; SPEECH; CONSTRAINTS; CONTEXT; VOWELS; IDENTIFICATION; CONSONANTS; DELETION	In natural conversations, words are generally shorter and they often lack segments. It is unclear to what extent such durational and segmental reductions affect word recognition. The present study investigates to what extent reduction in the initial syllable hinders word comprehension, which types of segments listeners mostly rely on, and whether listeners use word duration as a cue in word recognition. We conducted three experiments in Dutch, in which we adapted the gating paradigm to study the comprehension of spontaneously uttered conversational speech by aligning the gates with the edges of consonant clusters or vowels. Participants heard the context and some segmental and/or durational information from reduced target words with unstressed initial syllables. The initial syllable varied in its degree of reduction, and in half of the stimuli the vowel was not clearly present. Participants gave too short answers if they were only provided with durational information from the target words, which shows that listeners are unaware of the reductions that can occur in spontaneous speech. More importantly, listeners required fewer segments to recognize target words if the vowel in the initial syllable was absent. This result strongly suggests that this vowel hardly plays a role in word comprehension, and that its presence may even delay this process. More important are the consonants and the stressed vowel.

Street prestige boosts the diffusion of urban vernacular features	LANGUAGE IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Rapid linguistic diffusion; social meaning; streetwise prestige; speaker evaluation experiment; corpus linguistics; Twitter	LANGUAGE CHANGE; TWITTER; ENGLISH; CITETAAL	In this article, we investigate social meaning as a determinant of linguistic diffusion by confronting laboratory and corpus data of Citetaal, a multi-ethnolect that has spread across Flanders. In a speaker evaluation experiment, we found that Citetaal was upgraded on 'streetwise dynamism', even by respondents unfamiliar with its migrant origin. From this, we conclude that it is Citetaal's third-order indexicality, pruned of ethnic associations, which carries the diffusion. To determine the relative importance of streetwise cool vis-a-vis other predictors, we studied the diffusion across Twitter of the principal Citetaal shibboleth (/s/ palatalisation). As a production proxy for streetwise cool, we included expressive compensation strategies such as lengthening (verrry), which turned out to be among the main predictors of the Citetaal form. We argue that social meaning is a major change determinant, and that Twitter is the optimum source to track both a diffusion and the factors, including social meaning, which drive it.

J	Foucart, A; Brouwer, S				Foucart, Alice; Brouwer, Susanne			Is There a Foreign <i>Accent</i> Effect on Moral Judgment?	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						foreign accent; foreign language effect; emotion processing; cognitive disfluency; psychological distance	LANGUAGE; SPEAKERS; PERSPECTIVE; DILEMMAS; MODEL	Recent studies have shown that people make more utilitarian decisions when dealing with a moral dilemma in a foreign language than in their native language. Emotion, cognitive load, and psychological distance have been put forward as explanations for this foreign language effect. The question that arises is whether a similar effect would be observed when processing a dilemma in one's own language but spoken by a foreign-accented speaker. Indeed, foreign-accented speech has been shown to modulate emotion processing, to disrupt processing fluency and to increase psychological distance due to social categorisation. We tested this hypothesis by presenting 435 participants with two moral dilemmas, the trolley dilemma and the footbridge dilemma online, either in a native accent or a foreign accent. In Experiment 1, 184 native Spanish speakers listened to the dilemmas in Spanish recorded by a native speaker, a British English or a Cameroonian native speaker. In Experiment 2, 251 Dutch native speakers listened to the dilemmas in Dutch in their native accent, in a British English, a Turkish, or in a French accent. Results showed an increase in utilitarian decisions for the Cameroonian- and French-accented speech compared to the Spanish or Dutch native accent, respectively. When collapsing all the speakers from the two experiments, a similar increase in the foreign accent condition compared with the native accent condition was observed. This study is the first demonstration of a foreign accent effect on moral judgements, and despite the variability in the effect across accents, the findings suggest that a foreign accent, like a foreign language, is a linguistic context that modulates (neuro)cognitive mechanisms, and consequently, impacts our behaviour. More research is needed to follow up on this exploratory study and to understand the influence of factors such as emotion reduction, cognitive load, psychological distance, and speaker's idiosyncratic features on moral judgments.

J	Favier, S; Huettig, F				Favier, Saoradh; Huettig, Falk			Are there core and peripheral syntactic structures? Experimental evidence from Dutch native speakers with varying literacy levels	LINGUA			English	Article						Core grammar; Peripheral structures; Grammaticality judgments	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXPERIENCE; ACCOUNT; USAGE	Some theorists posit the existence of a 'core' grammar that virtually all native speakers acquire, and a 'peripheral' grammar that many do not. We investigated the viability of such a categorical distinction in the Dutch language. We first consulted linguists' intuitions as to the 'core' or 'peripheral' status of a wide range of grammatical structures. We then tested a selection of core- and peripheral-rated structures on naive participants with varying levels of literacy experience, using grammaticality judgement as a proxy for receptive knowledge. Overall, participants demonstrated better knowledge of `core' structures than 'peripheral' structures, but the considerable variability within these categories was strongly suggestive of a continuum rather than a categorical distinction between them. We also hypothesised that individual differences in the knowledge of core and peripheral structures would reflect participants' literacy experience. This was supported only by a small trend in our data. The results fit best with the notion that more frequent syntactic structures are mastered by more people than infrequent ones and challenge the received sense of a categorical core-periphery distinction.

Differences in phonological awareness performance Are there positive or negative effects of bilingual experience?	LINGUISTIC APPROACHES TO BILINGUALISM			English	Article						early-English education; bilingualism; phonological awareness; vocabulary; memory	CROSS-LANGUAGE TRANSFER; WORKING-MEMORY; ENGLISH; CHILDREN; SKILLS; IMPACT; 1ST	Children who have knowledge of two languages may show better phonological awareness than their monolingual peers (e.g. Bruck & Genesee, 1995). It remains unclear how much bilingual experience is needed for such advantages to appear, and whether differences in language or cognitive skills alter the relation between bilingualism and phonological awareness. These questions were investigated in this cross-sectional study. Participants (n=294; 4-7 year-olds, in the first three grades of primary school) were Dutch-speaking pupils attending mainstream monolingual Dutch primary schools or early-English schools providing English lessons from grade 1, and simultaneous Dutch-English bilinguals. We investigated phonological awareness (rhyming, phoneme blending, onset phoneme identification, and phoneme deletion) and its relation to age, Dutch vocabulary, English vocabulary, working memory and short-term memory, and the balance between Dutch and English vocabulary. Small significant (alpha<.05) effects of bilingualism were found on onset phoneme identification and phoneme deletion, but post-hoc comparisons revealed no robust pairwise differences between the groups. Furthermore, effects of bilingualism sometimes disappeared when differences in language or memory skills were taken into account. Learning two languages simultaneously is not beneficial to - and importantly, also not detrimental to - phonological awareness.

They realized nuclear Falls and Fall-Rises on four IP-final monosyllabic target words in which the duration of the sonorant portion of the syllable rhyme was varied by combining a short and a long vowel with a sonorant and obstruent coda consonant. The different contours were elicited with the help of a 'Statement' dialogue and a 'Rhetorical question' dialogue, respectively. Phonetic adjustments fell into three categories, target undershoot, increased f0 slopes, and durational easing, the latter either by f0 target retraction or sonorant rhyme lengthening. Talkers produced monosyllabic Fall-Rises quite generally, although avoidance in favour of a plain rising contour was evident in one-fifth of the cases of the shortest sonorant rhyme in the more prestigious varieties. Broadly, southwestern Zeelandic Dutch and northeastern Low Saxon differed most noticeably from each other in their treatment of the valley of the Fall-Rise, which Zeelandic maximally undershot and Low Saxon faithfully preserved. Urban Hollandic and Standard Dutch were similar, while West Frisian shares some features with Hollandic and some with Low Saxon. Apart from these effects of geographic contiguity, the data argue for an interpretation of the various measures alleviating time pressure within the more general conception of speech as a compromise between the interests of the speaker and those of the hearer in the process of speech communication.

We analyzed a lexicon based on a corpus of Dutch reading materials for primary school children to gain insight into the frequency distribution of different word types, i.e. words with similar word characteristics, both per grade and across grades. The frequencies of monomorphemic, concrete words and of polysemous words remained relatively stable, whereas that of multimorphemic and monomorphemic abstract words increased across grades. Within each grade, multimorphemic and monomorphemic, abstract words had lower frequencies than monomorphemic, concrete words. Difficult polysemous words were less frequent than easy polysemous words in all grades. Some additional explorations on a larger word set corroborated our findings.

However, little information is available on how this is done. The aim of this study is to gain insight into how nurses set goals and action plans with patients. Data were collected from three practice nurses working in elderly care and five patients in the Netherlands. Practice nurse is the term for the home care registered nurse in the Netherlands. Five home visits for which goal setting and action planning were the main agreed-upon objectives, were video-recorded and transcribed. We found that explicit goal setting was not observable. However, in 16 episodes, action plans were discussed. Action planning was always initiated by the nurse and was oriented toward offering professional help or assistance in order to solve the patient's problems. In response, patients tended to resist the proposed solutions, with the result that action planning was abandoned. By the nurse proposing professional help, patients were positioned as passive rather than active agents. Our results contribute to the understanding of how nurses' communicative behavior influences the extent to which patients feel encouraged to actively participate in goal setting/action planning.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether specific aspects of Web-based diabetes research news are associated with positive or negative sentiments in readers. Methods: A retrospective observational study of the comments on diabetes research news posted on Facebook pages was conducted as a function of the innovations' developmental phase, the intended treatment effect, and the use of strong language to intensify the news messages (superlatives). Data for the investigation were drawn from the diabetes research news posted between January 2014 and January 2018 on the two largest Dutch Facebook pages on diabetes and the corresponding reader comments. By manually coding these Facebook user comments, three binary outcome variables were created, reflecting the presence of a positive sentiment, the presence of a negative sentiment, and the presence of a statement expressing hopefulness. Results: Facebook users made a total of 3710 comments on 173 diabetes research news posts that were eligible for further analysis. Facebook user comments on posts about diabetes prevention (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.84), improved blood glucose regulation (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56-0.84), and symptom relief (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21-0.44) were associated with less positive sentiments as compared with potential diabetes cures. Furthermore, comments on innovations supported by preclinical evidence in animals were associated with more positive sentiments (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.07-1.99) and statements expressing hope (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14), when compared with innovations that have evidence from large human trials. This study found no evidence for the associations between language intensification of the news posts and the readers' sentiments. Conclusions: Our finding that the attitudes toward diabetes research news on Facebook are most positive when clinical efficacy is not (or not yet) proven in large patient trials suggests that news authors and editors, as well as medical professionals, must exercise caution when acting as a conduit for diabetes research news.

J	Richter, M; van Hout, R				Richter, Michael; van Hout, Roeland			Aspectual coercion of telic verbs and atelic adverbials in German: Acceptability judgments on sentences with conflicting aspectual information by native speakers	LINGUA			English	Article						Aspect; Coercion; Telicity; Verb classes; Mixed linear models	SYNTAX; SHIFT	The aim of this paper is to explain differences in the degrees of acceptability of sentences with co-occurring telic verbs and atelic durative time span adverbials. The interpretation of such sentences requires coercion of the aspectual information, solving the semantic mismatch by making the conflicting information compatible. Successful coercion means that a sentence will thereby achieve perfect acceptability, whereas less successful coercion will produce lower degrees of acceptability. The results of 37 participants rating the acceptability of 30 sentences with conflicting aspectual information were as follows: (1) Telic verbs describing a process promote successful coercion. (2) Specific semantic properties of the nominal phrases (NPs) contribute to coercion. Cumulative NPs denoting concrete entities (e.g., bare concrete mass nouns) promote coercion and so give higher acceptability scores. NPs denoting abstract entities promote coercion only when they are definite. The results show that the aspectual interpretation of sentences is supported by processes of semantic enrichment to resolve the co-occurrence of conflicting linguistic expressions. Our study also reveals that we need to address how we can implement contextual information in an experimental set-up to address the remaining gaps in explaining the differences in the acceptability ratings.

Effects of diabetes news characteristics on patients' perceptions and attitudes towards medical innovations and therapy adherence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTENSITY; LANGUAGE; SUBJECTIVITY; MESSAGE	Patients have ever-increasing access to web-based news about hopeful scientific developments that may or may not cure them in the future. Science communication experts agree that the quality of news provision is not always guaranteed. However, literature does not clarify in what way users are actually affected by typical news characteristics such as the news object (described developmental phase of an innovation), the news source (degree of authority), and the news style (degree of language intensification). An online vignette experiment (N = 259) investigated causal relationships between characteristics of news about diabetes innovations and patients' perceptions of future success, their interest in the innovation, and attitudes regarding current therapy adherence. Findings show that descriptions of success in mice led to higher estimations of future success chances than earlier and later developmental phases. Furthermore, news from a nonauthoritative source led to an increased interest in the innovation, and a more negative attitude towards current lifestyle advice. Lastly, the intensification of the language used in news messages showed slight adverse effects on the readers' attitude. These findings, combined with their small effect sizes, support the optimistic view that diabetes patients are generally critical assessors of health news and that future research on this topic should focus on affected fragile subgroups.

Here we propose that structural markedness may be a common factor underlying perceptions of playfulness and iconicity. Using collected and estimated lexical ratings covering a total of over 70,000 English words, we assess the robustness of this association. We identify cues of phonotactic complexity that covary with funniness and iconicity ratings and that, we propose, serve as metacommunicative signals to draw attention to words as playful and performative. To assess the generalisability of the findings we develop a method to estimate lexical ratings from distributional semantics and apply it to a dataset 20 times the size of the original set of human ratings. The method can be used more generally to extend coverage of lexical ratings. We find that it reliably reproduces correlations between funniness and iconicity as well as cues of structural markedness, though it also amplifies biases present in the human ratings. Our study shows that the playful and the poetic are part of the very texture of the lexicon.

Younger adults additionally benefit from manual iconic co-speech gestures. Here, we investigate to what extent younger and older adults benefit from perceiving both visual articulators while comprehending SiN, and whether this is modulated by working memory and inhibitory control. Twenty-eight younger and 28 older adults performed a word recognition task in three visual contexts: mouth blurred (speech-only), visible speech, or visible speech + iconic gesture. The speech signal was either clear or embedded in multitalker babble. Additionally, there were two visual-only conditions (visible speech, visible speech + gesture). Accuracy levels for both age groups were higher when both visual articulators were present compared to either one or none. However, older adults received a significantly smaller benefit than younger adults, although they performed equally well in speech-only and visual-only word recognition. Individual differences in verbal working memory and inhibitory control partly accounted for age-related performance differences. To conclude, perceiving iconic gestures in addition to visible speech improves younger and older adults' comprehension of SiN. Yet, the ability to benefit from this additional visual information is modulated by age and verbal working memory. Future research will have to show whether these findings extend beyond the single word level.

Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent ('old'), matched two antecedents ('ambiguous'), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features ('partial-match'), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, 'new'). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an 'old/new' judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.

Despite their striking differences they share the property of iconicity, understood as the direct relationship between a symbol and its referent. Here we investigate whether non-signing hearing adults exploit their implicit knowledge of gestures to bootstrap accurate understanding of the meaning of iconic signs they have never seen before. In Study 1 we show that for some concepts gestures exhibit systematic forms across participants, and share different degrees of form overlap with the signs for the same concepts (full, partial, and no overlap). In Study 2 we found that signs with stronger resemblance with signs are more accurately guessed and are assigned higher iconicity ratings by non-signers than signs with low overlap. In addition, when more people produced a systematic gesture resembling a sign, they assigned higher iconicity ratings to that sign. Furthermore, participants had a bias to assume that signs represent actions and not objects. The similarities between some signs and gestures could be explained by deaf signers and hearing gesturers sharing a conceptual substrate that is rooted in our embodied experiences with the world. The finding that gestural knowledge can ease the interpretation of the meaning of novel signs and predicts iconicity ratings is in line with embodied accounts of cognition and the influence of prior knowledge to acquire new schemas. Through these mechanisms we propose that iconic gestures that overlap in form with signs may serve as some type of 'manual cognates' that help non-signing adults to break into a new language at first exposure.

Turkish-Dutch early bilinguals who are dominant in their L2 (Dutch) performed an auditory lexical decision task in Turkish or Dutch. While Dutch has variable word stress, with a tendency for penultimate stress, stress in Turkish is mostly predictable and usually falls on the ultimate syllable. Our tasks included two-syllable cognates with penultimate stress in both languages, ultimate stress in both languages, or ultimate stress in Turkish and penultimate stress in Dutch. Some cognate facilitation effects arose in Dutch, while inhibition was found in Turkish. Cognates with ultimate stress were processed faster than cognates with penultimate stress, in both languages. This shows that in Turkish-Dutch early bilinguals, cognate processing depends on Turkish stress position, although Dutch is dominant. Together, the findings support the view that cognates have separate, though linked representations.

However, accurate ASR for dysarthric speech remains a serious challenge. Dearth of usable data remains a problem in applying ML and DNN techniques for dysarthric speech recognition. In the current research, we address this challenge using a novel two-stage data augmentation scheme, a combination of static and dynamic data augmentation techniques that are designed by leveraging an understanding of the characteristics of dysarthric speech. Deep Autoencoder (DAE)-based healthy speech modification and various perturbations comprise static augmentations, whereas SpecAugment techniques modified to specifically augment dysarthric speech comprise the dynamic data augmentation. The objective of this work is to improve the ASR performance for dysarthric speech using the two-stage data augmentation scheme. An end-to-end ASR using a Transformer acoustic model is used to evaluate the data augmentation scheme on speech from the UA dysarthric speech corpus. We achieve an absolute improvement of 16% in word error rate (WER) over a baseline with no augmentation, with a final WER of 20.6%.

Methods: Based on literature from different fields, we review several issues that play a role when designing feedback for computerized speech training, including serious games. Results: Which speech dimensions (e.g., articulation, loudness) to target in computerized speech feedback, and at what level of detail to provide the feedback, depend on the focus of the specific speech therapy and the technical feasibility of providing reliable speech feedback. Furthermore, feedback that provides knowledge of results generally appears equally effective as knowledge of performance feedback, and is more easily provided in computerized speech training systems. Implicit feedback can be more motivating than explicit feedback (e.g., in serious games), but may be harder to understand. Multimodal feedback is preferred over unimodal feedback to ensure that the feedback message is optimally perceived. Mild negative task-oriented feedback can enhance effort but should be balanced with positive feedback, such as feedback referring to patients' progress. Finally, a balance should be found between the motivational advantages of high-frequency immediate feedback (e.g., in serious games) and the advantages of low-frequency and delayed feedback in preventing patients from becoming dependent on augmented feedback. Conclusions: Several aspects play a role in designing feedback for computerized speech training for dysarthric speakers. Decisions on these aspects should be made carefully, accounting for the specific characteristics of the patient group that is targeted, the focus of the specific speech therapy, and the technological possibilities that are available.

Yet, early stages of learning are characterized by high levels of uncertainty, which obscures the process of error detection. We examine how uncertainty about L2 syntactic representations, induced by different levels of language conflict, is reflected in ERN patterns during learning. German learners of Dutch performed a feedback-guided gender decision task in their L2 and provided subjective certainty ratings for their responses. Initially, high-conflict items yielded more uncertainty and ERN modulations were reversed (i.e., correct responses elicited larger amplitudes than errors). Two rounds of feedback resulted in an increase of accuracy, reduced uncertainty, and normalization of the ERN effect, signaling effective error monitoring. These outcomes demonstrate how subjective intuitions about response accuracy affect performance monitoring during L2 learning.

Such vocal "enrichments" might include reductions in speech rate or increases in acoustic contrasts. However, it is unclear how consistently speakers enrich their speech over time. This study examined inter-speaker variability in the speech enrichment modifications applied by speakers. The study compared a baseline habitual speaking style to a clear-Lombard style and measured changes in acoustic differences between the two styles over sentence trials. Seventy-eight young adult participants read out sentences in the habitual and clear-Lombard speaking styles. Acoustic differences between speaking styles generally increased nonlinearly over trials, suggesting that speakers require practice before realizing their full speech enrichment potential when speaking clearly in noise with reduced auditory feedback. Using a recent objective intelligibility metric based on glimpses, the study also found that predicted intelligibility increased over trials, highlighting that communicative benefits of the clear-Lombard style are not static. These findings underline the dynamic nature of speaking styles. (c) 2023 Author(s).

We collected new colour naming data in Japanese and three under-described Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama) to investigate semantic variation and change in the colour lexicon of related languages in a modern context. We found several new colour terms (e.g., midori and guriin for 'green') in the lexicon of Ryukyuan speakers, apparently resulting from contact with Standard Japanese and English. A comparison of our data with historical data suggests that modern Ryukyuan colour systems are closer to modern Japanese than they are to their historic pasts. However, we also found that modern-day Ryukyuan languages are more similar to each other than they are to Japanese. These findings show the scope of semantic changes that can occur through outside influence and highlight the need for fresh empirical data in the study of semantics in related languages.

This inter-speaker variation is reflected in the different transcriptions of Kaifeng L that have been given in the literature. We argue that a L-tone is intrinsically less salient than a H-tone, due to a lack of phonetic space in the low pitch range as well as to a potential ambiguity between contextual low pitch around f0 peaks and low pitch due to L-tones, and thus more likely to be enhanced.

Structured interviews can be used to obtain this information, but these are time-consuming and not scalable. Questionnaires provide an alternative way to extract such information, yet they typically lack depth. In this paper, we present our first prototype of the Behaviour-based Language-Interactive Speaking Systems (BLISS), an artificial intelligent agent which intends to automatically discover what makes people happy and healthy. The goal of BLISS is to understand the motivations behind people's happiness by conducting a personalized spoken dialogue based on a happiness model. We built our first prototype of the model to collect 55 spoken dialogues, in which the BLISS agent asked questions to users about their happiness and well-being. Apart from a description of the BLISS architecture, we also provide details about our dataset, which contains mentions of over 120 activities and 100 motivations and is made available for usage.

This positive correlation between explicitness and complexity, best known as the Complexity Principle, has been observed for a multitude of case studies in both naturally occurring language and experimental settings. Researchers have sought the explanation for this Complexity Principle in three different domains: cognitive comprehension processing, the language channel, and cognitive production processing. Based on these accounts, we formulate predictions regarding the action radius of the Complexity Principle in the alternation between a direct and prepositional object of the Dutch verb zoeken 'search'. These predictions are tested against corpus observations. Our results confirm accounts according to which optional elements indicate production difficulties, as well as those that explain the Principle as a result of restrictions on the language channel. In addition, our results indicate that the Principle is sensitive to context-determined restrictions that are the result of its underlying cause. This may present a possible caveat for alternation studies.

In this meta-analysis, we measured the effect size of cross-linguistic influence and systematically assessed its predictors in 750 simultaneous and early sequential bilingual children in 17 unique language combinations across 26 experimental studies. We found a significant small to moderate average effect size of cross-linguistic influence, indicating that cross-linguistic influence is part and parcel of bilingual development. Language dominance, operationalized as societal language, was a significant predictor of cross-linguistic influence, whereas surface overlap, language domain and age were not. Perhaps an even more important finding was that definitions and operationalisations of cross-linguistic influence and its predictors varied considerably between studies. This could explain the absence of a comprehensive theory in the field. To solve this issue, we argue for a more uniform method of studying cross-linguistic influence.

Emotions, fast and slow: processing of emotion words is affected by individual differences in need for affect and narrative absorption	COGNITION & EMOTION			English	Article						Emotion; individual differences; eye-tracking; narratives; language processing	PERSUASION	Emotional words have consistently been shown to be processed differently than neutral words. However, few studies have examined individual variability in emotion word processing with longer, ecologically valid stimuli (beyond isolated words, sentences, or paragraphs). In the current study, we re-analysed eye-tracking data collected during story reading to reveal how individual differences in need for affect and narrative absorption impact the speed of emotion word reading. Word emotionality was indexed by affective-aesthetic potentials (AAP) calculated by a sentiment analysis tool. We found that individuals with higher levels of need for affect and narrative absorption read positive words more slowly. On the other hand, these individual differences did not influence the reading time of more negative words, suggesting that high need for affect and narrative absorption are characterised by a positivity bias only. In general, unlike most previous studies using more isolated emotion word stimuli, we observed a quadratic (U-shaped) effect of word emotionality on reading speed, such that both positive and negative words were processed more slowly than neutral words. Taken together, this study emphasises the importance of taking into account individual differences and task context when studying emotion word processing.

In a large body of literature, RTs are measured from the onset of the stimulus to the start of the response (often a button press or an oral response). The rationale behind this choice is that information about the stimulus becomes available to the listener starting at onset. Alternatively, the RT from offset is less dependent on stimulus duration and is assumed to focus on those cognitive processes that play a role late(r) in the word and after word offset, when all information is available. The paper presents RT-onset and RT-offset-based linear mixed effects models for three different lexical decision-based data sets and explains the significant differences between these models, showing to what extent both definitions of reaction time reveal different roles for predictors and how early and later contributions to the overall RT can be differentiated.

Alongside Javanese, this community also speaks Sranantongo and Dutch, of which Sranantongo had the longest contact history with Javanese. It is shown that this long period of contact had a structural influence on the expression of transfer events in Surinamese Javanese: Surinamese speakers use double object constructions and twopredicate constructions more frequently than homeland Javanese speakers, a change which we argue to be due to contact with Sranantongo. In addition, Surinamese Javanese speakers overgeneralize one of the two applicative suffixes found in transfer constructions, a phenomenon that results from simplification processes.

This implies that these models learn to recognise speech in a biologically unrealistic manner, i.e. with prior lexical knowledge and explicit supervision. In contrast, visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without prior lexical knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and visual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech models learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly investigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition. We investigate the time course of noun and verb recognition as simulated by the model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected by well-known word competition effects in human speech processing. We furthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete representation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of words. Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise nouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and singular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition from the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word competition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence that vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words, though our gating experiment does show that the LSTM-VQ model is able to recognise the target words earlier.

J	Hubers, F; Cucchiarini, C; Strik, H; Dijkstra, T				Hubers, Ferdy; Cucchiarini, Catia; Strik, Helmer; Dijkstra, Ton			Normative Data of Dutch Idiomatic Expressions: Subjective Judgments You Can Bank on	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						idiomatic expressions; Dutch; subjective judgements; reliability; idiom knowledge	FORMULAIC LANGUAGE; FAMILIARITY; NORMS; DECOMPOSABILITY; COMPREHENSION; CONCRETENESS; IMAGERY	The processing of idiomatic expressions is a topical issue in empirical research. Various factors have been found to influence idiom processing, such as idiom familiarity and idiom transparency. Information on these variables is usually obtained through norming studies. Studies investigating the effect of various properties on idiom processing have led to ambiguous results. This may be due to the variability of operationalizations of the idiom properties across norming studies, which in turn may affect the reliability of the subjective judgements. However, not all studies that collected normative data on idiomatic expressions investigated their reliability, and studies that did address the reliability of subjective ratings used various measures and produced mixed results. In this study, we investigated the reliability of subjective judgements, the relation between subjective and objective idiom frequency, and the impact of these dimensions on the participants' idiom knowledge by collecting normative data of five subjective idiom properties (Frequency of Exposure, Meaning Familiarity, Frequency of Usage, Transparency, and Imageability) from 390 native speakers and objective corpus frequency for 374 Dutch idiomatic expressions. For reliability, we compared measures calculated in previous studies, with the D-coefficient, a metric taken from Generalizability Theory. High reliability was found for all subjective dimensions. One reliability metric, Krippendorff's alpha, generally produced lower values, while similar values were obtained for three other measures (Cronbach's alpha, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, and the D-coefficient). Advantages of the D-coefficient are that it can be applied to unbalanced research designs, and to estimate the minimum number of raters required to obtain reliable ratings. Slightly higher coefficients were observed for so-called experience-based dimensions (Frequency of Exposure, Meaning Familiarity, and Frequency of Usage) than for content-based dimensions (Transparency and Imageability). In addition, fewer raters were required to obtain reliable ratings for the experience-based dimensions. Subjective and objective frequency appeared to be poorly correlated, while all subjective idiom properties and objective frequency turned out to affect idiom knowledge. Meaning Familiarity, Subjective and Objective Frequency of Exposure, Frequency of Usage, and Transparency positively contributed to idiom knowledge, while a negative effect was found for Imageability. We discuss these relationships in more detail, and give methodological recommendations with respect to the procedures and the measure to calculate reliability.

Why is this the case? To answer this question, this paper provides a systematic review of the literature on non-native spoken-word recognition in the presence of background noise, and posits an updated theory on the effect of background noise on native and non-native spoken-word recognition. The picture that arises is that although spoken-word recognition in the presence of background noise is harder in a non-native language than in one's native language, this difference is not due to a differential effect of background noise on native and non-native listening. Rather, it can be explained by differences in language exposure, which influences the uptake and use of phonetic and contextual information in the speech signal for spoken-word recognition.

J	Bashori, M; van Hout, R; Strik, H; Cucchiarini, C				Bashori, Muzakki; van Hout, Roeland; Strik, Helmer; Cucchiarini, Catia			Effects of ASR-based websites on EFL learners' vocabulary, speaking anxiety, and language enjoyment	SYSTEM			English	Article						Automatic speech recognition; Vocabulary; Foreign language speaking anxiety; Foreign language enjoyment	ACQUISITION; CONTEXT; ENGLISH; SIZE	A vocabulary deficit negatively affects students' language performance. Emotions such as speaking anxiety and language enjoyment in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom can affect students' achievements as well. We investigated the effects of two Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-based websites, I Love Indonesia (ILI) and Novo Learning (NOVO), on students' vocabulary knowledge, speaking anxiety, and language enjoyment. A total of 232 secondary school students in Indonesia participated in our quasi experimental study. They were divided into three groups: two experimental groups received ASR-based intervention (ILI, NOVO), and a control group attended regular classes. Findings revealed that the students from the two experimental groups (ILI and NOVO) significantly outperformed those of the control group: both websites successfully increased the students' knowledge of the targeted vocabulary (40 words), reduced the students' level of speaking anxiety, and stimulated the students' language enjoyment. Additionally, we interviewed 12 of these students and three English teachers. These qualitative outcomes corroborate the quantitative conclusions. Future studies should investigate further benefits of ASR-based websites on speaking skills, especially for long term effects, with in-depth evaluations, as this would help teachers to optimally design and adapt these systems for foreign language learning.

J	van der Meulen, M; Rutten, G				van der Meulen, Marten; Rutten, Gijsbert			Prescriptivism on its own terms. Perceptions and realities of usage in Siegenbeek's <i>Lijst</i> (1847)	LANGUAGE & HISTORY			English	Article						Dutch; prescriptivism; Matthijs Siegenbeek; frequency judgements; corpus linguistics; purism; standardisation		In 1847, one of the first professors of Dutch, Matthijs Siegenbeek (1774-1854), published a purist word list entitled Lijst van woorden en uitdrukkingen met het Nederlandsch taaleigen strijdende, 'List of words and expressions at odds with the nature of Dutch'. In this pamphlet, he condemned a variety of loanwords and loan translations. Siegenbeek refers regularly to the usage of disapproved variants, employing a variety of quantifiers and sociolinguistic references. How well such statements reflect the linguistic reality, however, is a contentious issue in studies of prescriptivism. In this paper, we study Siegenbeek's pronouncements about usage against the backdrop of Curzan's concept of restorative prescriptivism. By studying the use of different types of quantifiers, and matching these to a text collection of historical fiction from the time, we show that Siegenbeek's statements about usage miss the mark for most specific variables. However, when we look at the average usage frequency, we see that as frequency terms increase in strength, so do the number of condemned variants, both for relative frequency and absolute frequency. Based on these results, we argue for a re-evaluation of the relationship between prescriptivism and usage, and a reappreciation of prescriptivists' frequency judgements.

In this two-stage content analysis, we examine the portrayal of physics in five major Dutch newspapers. Results show that astronomy and astrophysics is the most prominent field. Furthermore, newspaper articles are triggered almost equally by scientific and non-scientific events. Finally, the majority of described physics concepts are framed as difficult, but journalists do provide explanations for them.

Negative language use of the physiotherapist in low back pain education impacts anxiety and illness beliefs: A randomised controlled trial in healthy respondents	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article; Early Access						Nocebo effect; Communication; Physical therapy; Anxiety; Illness beliefs	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL; MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; PHYSICAL-THERAPY; VIDEO-VIGNETTES; NOCEBO; PLACEBO; PERCEPTION; VALIDATION; ENGAGEMENT; CLINICIAN	Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of physiotherapists' negative language use on nocebo effects of state anxiety and illness beliefs.Methods: A web-based randomised controlled trial included adults without recent musculoskeletal pain. The intervention was a short educational video about low back pain using negative language (nocebo condition: n = 87) versus a video using neutral or positive language (control condition: n = 82). State anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Illness beliefs were assessed using the Illness Perception Questionnaire.Results: Nocebo and control groups differed in outcome measures (MANOVA Pillai's trace = 0.22, F = 4.98; df = (9,159), p < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses showed a medium to large effect for the nocebo condition on anxiety (d = 0.71, 95% CI 0.4 -1.0). The nocebo group also had higher scores in three illness beliefs: beliefs on timeline (d = 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 - 0.75), treatment control (d = 0.43, 95% CI 0.12 - 0.74) and concern (d = 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 - 0.78).Conclusion: Physiotherapists' use of negative language contributes directly to a higher state anxiety and illness beliefs that can trigger the nocebo effects in the recipientPractice implications: Negative language use should be avoided.

J	Stoffelsma, L; Van Charldorp, TC				Stoffelsma, Lieke; Van Charldorp, Tessa Cyrina			A closer look at the interactional construction of choral responses in South African township schools	LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Classroom interaction; Choral responses; Choral reading; Conversation analysis; Literacy development	DISCOURSE; LANGUAGE	In order to better understand literacy practices in high poverty L2 contexts, we use a conversation analytic approach to study two forms of chorusing in Grade 3 classrooms in South African township schools: choral reading and choral answering. Based on more than 6 hours of video recorded classroom interaction, we show that choral reading aloud is initiated by explicit and implicit instructions, combined with intonational cues. Choral answering is initiated by yes/no questions, designedly incomplete utterances or known-answer questions, producing short answers. Teacher feedback in both forms is extremely limited. Choral practices risk limited individual student engagement and restrict development of language and cognitive skills. However, we also show that students demonstrate a high awareness of the subtleties of a variety of interactional "rules". They are occasionally encouraged to produce their own answers and are capable of reading new pieces of text aloud, showing potential learning opportunities through classroom engagement.

J	Grondelaers, S; van Gent, P				Grondelaers, Stefan; van Gent, Paul			Aicha Is More Dutch but Less Dynamic than Ahmed: The Gendered Nature of Race in the Netherlands	DUTCH CROSSING-JOURNAL OF LOW COUNTRIES STUDIES			English	Article						Intersectionality; gendered race; stereotyping; accent attitudes; conservative prestige; modern prestige	MUSLIMS	In this article we rely on accent evaluation to test the 'intersectional invisibility hypothesis'(1) that social cognition about men (but not women) is overrepresented in group-level beliefs.(2) As a case in point, we investigate the evaluation of male and female Moroccan accents to gain insight into impression formation of Muslims in the Netherlands, and to find out whether stereotypical qualities associated with Moroccan-Dutch people, such as aggressive, macho, and criminal, are in fact associated with Moroccan-Dutch men. Two matched-guise experiments featuring regional and ethnic accents of Dutch (one with male speakers, one with female speakers) confirm the intersectional invisibility hypothesis, but the inclusion of traditional and modern prestige measures in accent evaluation research results in arguably richer stereotype and prejudice accounts, and in this sense, the present investigation adds nuance and shade to Gloria Wekker's (2016) pessimistic account of racism in Dutch society. Male Moroccan-Dutch speech is strongly deprecated and is always deemed inferior to indigenous speech; at the same time it is also found to be the most dynamically prestigious of all accents. Female Moroccan-Dutch speech does not engender extreme reactions, but it is not regarded as dynamic either and a long way from being accepted as indigenous speech.

Can the two languages influence each other in such individuals despite differences in the visual (sign) and vocal (speech) modalities of expression? We investigated cross-linguistic influences on bimodal bilinguals' expression of spatial relations. Unlike spoken languages, sign uses iconic linguistic forms that resemble physical features of objects in a spatial relation and thus expresses specific semantic information. Hearing bimodal bilinguals (n = 21) fluent in Dutch and Sign Language of the Netherlands and their hearing nonsigning and deaf signing peers (n = 20 each) described left/right relations between two objects. Bimodal bilinguals expressed more specific information about physical features of objects in speech than nonsigners, showing influence from sign language. They also used fewer iconic signs with specific semantic information than deaf signers, demonstrating influence from speech. Bimodal bilinguals' speech and signs are shaped by two languages from different modalities.

Reading about minds: The social-cognitive potential of narratives	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Review						Narrative; Reading; Social cognition; Empathy	LITERARY FICTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INCREASES EMPATHY; IMPROVE THEORY; EXPOSURE; TRANSPORTATION; LANGUAGE; NEED; SIMULATION; MEDIA	It is often argued that narratives improve social cognition, either by appealing to social-cognitive abilities as we engage with the story world and its characters, or by conveying social knowledge. Empirical studies have found support for both a correlational and a causal link between exposure to (literary, fictional) narratives and social cognition. However, a series of failed replications has cast doubt on the robustness of these claims. Here, we review the existing empirical literature and identify open questions and challenges. An important conclusion of the review is that previous research has given too little consideration to the diversity of narratives, readers, and social-cognitive processes involved in the social-cognitive potential of narratives. We therefore establish a research agenda, proposing that future research should focus on (1) the specific text characteristics that drive the social-cognitive potential of narratives, (2) the individual differences between readers with respect to their sensitivity to this potential, and (3) the various aspects of social cognition that are potentially affected by reading narratives. Our recommendations can guide the design of future studies that will help us understand how, for whom, and in what respect exposure to narratives can advantage social cognition.

Hierarchy in language interpretation: evidence from behavioural experiments and computational modelling	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Syntax; constituency; meaning; human-like generalisation; LSTM	UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR; ANAPHORIC ONE; ACQUISITION; SENTENCE; SYNTAX; CONNECTIONISM; ARCHITECTURE; STATISTICS; RECURSION; POVERTY	It has long been recognised that phrases and sentences are organised hierarchically, but many computational models of language treat them as sequences of words without computing constituent structure. Against this background, we conducted two experiments which showed that participants interpret ambiguous noun phrases, such as second blue ball, in terms of their abstract hierarchical structure rather than their linear surface order. When a neural network model was tested on this task, it could simulate such "hierarchical" behaviour. However, when we changed the training data such that they were not entirely unambiguous anymore, the model stopped generalising in a human-like way. It did not systematically generalise to novel items, and when it was trained on ambiguous trials, it strongly favoured the linear interpretation. We argue that these models should be endowed with a bias to make generalisations over hierarchical structure in order to be cognitively adequate models of human language.

Automatic coherence analysis of Dutch: testing the subjectivity hypothesis on a larger scale	CORPORA			English	Article						automatic text analysis; causality; connectives; discourse coherence; Dutch; subjectivity	CONNECTIVES	With the increasing availability of large corpora, quantitative corpus analysis is becoming more and more popular as a method for conducting linguistic research. This paper uses a new research tool (CESAR) that makes it possible to search syntactically annotated corpora without extensive programming knowledge to study the subjectivity patterns of four Dutch causal connectives. Analysing a large set of causal relations marked by four of the most frequent Dutch causal connectives (daarom, dus, omdat and want), this case study aims to corroborate the subjectivity hypothesis established on the basis of smaller-scale studies that used manual annotation. The automatic analysis of the subjectivity patterns of Dutch causal connectives illustrates the usability of CESAR in particular and the feasibility of automatic coherence analysis in general. In addition, it generates new insights into the subjectivity patterns of daarom, dus, omdat and want.	[Hoek, Jet; Spooren, Wilbert P. M.

Neuroscientific studies indicate that the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) in the premotor cortex and mentalizing system (MS) in the medial prefrontal cortex support inferences about contextually unusual actions. However, little is known regarding the brain dynamics of these systems when viewing communicatively exaggerated kinematics. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, 28 participants viewed stick-light videos of pantomime gestures, recorded in a previous study, which contained varying degrees of communicative exaggeration. Participants made either social or nonsocial classifications of the videos. Using participant responses and pantomime kinematics, we modeled the probability of each video being classified as communicative. Interregion connectivity and activity were modulated by kinematic exaggeration, depending on the task. In the Social Task, communicativeness of the gesture increased activation of several pMNS and MS regions and modulated top-down coupling from the MS to the pMNS, but engagement of the pMNS and MS was not found in the nonsocial task. Our results suggest that expectation violations can be a key cue for inferring communicative intention, extending previous findings from wholly unexpected actions to more subtle social signaling.

First Encounters: Repair Sequences in Cross-Signing	TOPICS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Other-initiated repair; Try-markers; Contact pidgin; Sign language; Turn-timing; Cross-signing; Gesture	TURN-TAKING; ORGANIZATION; INITIATION; EXERCISE	Most human communication is between people who speak or sign the same languages. Nevertheless, communication is to some extent possible where there is no language in common, as every tourist knows. How this works is of some theoretical interest (Levinson, ). A nice arena to explore this capacity is when deaf signers of different languages meet for the first time and are able to use the iconic affordances of sign to begin communication. Here we focus on other-initiated repair (OIR), that is, where one signer makes clear he or she does not understand, thus initiating repair of the prior conversational turn. OIR sequences are typically of a three-turn structure (Schegloff ), including the problem source turn (T-1), the initiation of repair (T0), and the turn offering a problem solution (T+1). These sequences seem to have a universal structure (Dingemanse etal. 2013). We find that in most cases where such OIR occur, the signer of the troublesome turn (T-1) foresees potential difficulty and marks the utterance with try markers (Moerman, ; Sacks & Schegloff, ) which pause to invite recognition. The signers use repetition, gestural holds, prosodic lengthening, and eyegaze at the addressee as such try-markers. Moreover, when T-1 is try-marked this allows for faster response times of T+1 with respect to T0. This finding suggests that signers in these first encounter situations actively anticipate potential trouble and, through try-marking, mobilize and facilitate OIRs. The suggestion is that heightened meta-linguistic awareness can be utilized to deal with these problems at the limits of our communicational ability. Byun etal. describe how deaf signers deal with communication problems in first encounters with signers of different languages. They show that the basic Conversation Analytic repair mechanisms for dealing with verbal troubles are largely reproduced in gesture and sign, including details of turn-taking structure, timing and form. This underlines the role of repair as a basic resource for linguistic and interactional creativity across modalities.

As argued by Romer, typical scoring rubrics ignore important information about proficiency encoded at the lexis-grammar interface, in particular how the co-selection of lexical and grammatical features is mediated by communicative function. This is especially evident when assessing oral versus written exam tasks, where the modality of a task may intersect with register-induced variation in linguistic output. This article presents the results of an empirical study in which we measured the diversity and sophistication of four-word lexical bundles extracted from a corpus of French proficiency exams. Analysis revealed that the diversity of noun-based bundles was a significant predictor of written proficiency scores and the sophistication of verb-based bundles was a significant predictor of proficiency scores across both modes, suggesting that communicative function as well as the constraints of online planning mediated the effect of lexicogrammatical phenomena on proficiency scores. Importantly, lexicogrammatical measures were better predictors of proficiency than solely lexical-based measures, which speaks to the potential utility of considering lexicogrammatical competence on scoring rubrics.

Participants were Dutch primary school pupils of three different age groups (4-5, 8-9, and 11-12 years) who either were enrolled in an early-English schooling program or were age-matched controls not on that early-English program. Participants performed tasks that measured switching, inhibition, and working memory. Early-English program pupils had greater knowledge of English vocabulary and more balanced Dutch-English lexicons. In both groups, lexical balance, a ratio measure obtained by dividing vocabulary scores in English by those in Dutch, was related to switching but not to inhibition or working memory performance. These results show that for children who are learning an L2 in an instructional setting, and for whom managing two languages is not yet an automatized process, language balance may be more important than L2 proficiency in influencing the relation between childhood bilingualism and switching abilities.

The present study addresses the talker familiarity benefit in non-native listening, and the role of listening conditions and listeners' lexical proficiency in the emergence of this benefit. Dutch non-native listeners of English were trained to identify four English talkers over 4 days. Talker familiarity benefit in recognition memory was investigated using a recognition memory task with " old" and " new" words produced by familiar and unfamiliar talkers presented either in the clear or in noise. Talker familiarity benefit in word identification was investigated by comparing non-native listeners' performances on the first and the last day in identifying words in different noise levels, produced by either a trained (included in the voice recognition training) or by an untrained talker (not included in the voice recognition training). Non-native listeners demonstrated a talker familiarity benefit in recognition memory, which was modulated by listening conditions and proficiency in the non-native language. No talker familiarity benefit was found in word identification. These results suggest that, similar to native listening, both linguistic and indexical (talker-specific) information influence non-native speech perception. However, this is dependent on the task and type of speech recognition process involved.

Researchers typically use manual coding of video data to characterize naturalistic, meaningful movements at various levels of description, but the availability of markerless motion-tracking technology allows for quantification of the kinematic features of gestures or any meaningful human movement. We present a novel protocol for extracting a set of kinematic features from movements recorded with Microsoft Kinect. Our protocol captures spatial and temporal features, such as height, velocity, submovements/strokes, and holds. This approach is based on studies of communicative actions and gestures and attempts to capture features that are consistently implicated as important kinematic aspects of communication. We provide open-source code for the protocol, a description of how the features are calculated, a validation of these features as quantified by our protocol versus manual coders, and a discussion of how the protocol can be applied. The protocol effectively quantifies kinematic features that are important in the production (e.g., characterizing different contexts) as well as the comprehension (e.g., used by addressees to understand intent and semantics) of manual acts. The protocol can also be integrated with qualitative analysis, allowing fast and objective demarcation of movement units, providing accurate coding even of complex movements. This can be useful to clinicians, as well as to researchers studying multimodal communication or human-robot interactions. By making this protocol available, we hope to provide a tool that can be applied to understanding meaningful movement characteristics in human communication.

Cultural Value Adaptation in Advertising is Effective, But Not Dependable: A Meta-Analysis of 25?Years of Experimental Research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION			English	Article; Early Access						advertising; cultural adaptation; cultural dimensions; persuasion; globalization	PERSUASION; APPEALS; INDIVIDUALISM; CONSEQUENCES; PERCEPTIONS; PSYCHOLOGY; MESSAGES; IMPACT; TESTS	Advertisers sometimes use value appeals that are adapted to their specific cultural audience. After a meta-analysis in 2009 showing cultural value adaptation to be effective, new studies have been published and the advertising landscape has rapidly changed. The current meta-analysis involving about 120 comparisons of adapted versus unadapted value appeals on persuasion and ad liking presents three results. First, cultural value adaptation effects in advertising exist (persuasion: mean r = .049; ad liking: mean r = .055). Second, these adaptation effects have diminished over time (correlations between year of publication and persuasion effects: r = -.152; between year of publication and ad liking: r = -.185). Third, the adaptation effects do not allow for dependable advice for practitioners. We discuss these results in the context of globalization and the standardization-adaptation debate.

Evaluating information-theoretic measures of word prediction in naturalistic sentence reading	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Predictive processing; Sentence processing; Next-word entropy; Surprisal; Lookahead information gain; Reading time; Electroencephalography; Psycholinguistics; Computational linguistics	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN; PREDICTABILITY; DISCOURSE; TIME	We review information-theoretic measures of cognitive load during sentence processing that have been used to quantify word prediction effort. Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view. We propose a novel metric, lookahead information gain, that can overcome these short-comings. We estimate the different measures using probabilistic language models. Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.

We investigated their effects on the processing of subsequent (un)predictable words, and on the quality of word representations in memory. Participants read dialogues with (un)predictable endings that followed a discourse marker (eigenlijk in Experiment 1, inderdaad in Experiment 2) or a control adverb. We found no strong evidence that discourse markers modulated online predictability effects elicited by subsequently read words. However, words following eigenlijk elicited an enhanced posterior post-N400 positivity compared with words following an adverb regardless of their predictability, potentially reflecting increased processing costs associated with pragmatically driven discourse updating. No effects of inderdaad were found on online processing, but inderdaad seemed to influence memory for (un)predictable dialogue endings. These findings nuance our understanding of how pragmatic markers affect incremental language comprehension.

Literacy Advantages Beyond Reading: Prediction of Spoken Language	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							EYE-MOVEMENT CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORD-FREQUENCY; VOCABULARY; ACQUISITION; CHILDREN; READERS	Literacy has many obvious benefits: it exposes the reader to a wealth of new information and enhances syntactic knowledge. However, we argue that literacy has an additional, often overlooked, benefit: it enhances people's ability to predict spoken language thereby aiding comprehension. Readers are under pressure to process information more quickly than listeners and reading provides excellent conditions - in particular, a stable environment - for training the predictive system. It also leads to increased awareness of words as linguistic units and to more fine-grained phonological and additional orthographic representations, which sharpen lexical representations and facilitate the retrieval of predicted representations. Thus, reading trains core processes and representations involved in language prediction that are common to both reading and listening.

Dissociating activation and integration of discourse referents: Evidence from ERPs and oscillations	CORTEX			English	Article						Reference resolution; Anaphora; Proper names; Theta; Gamma	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; WORD REPETITION; SENTENCE-LEVEL; PROPER-NAMES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	A key challenge in understanding stories and conversations is the comprehension of 'anaphora', words that refer back to previously mentioned words or concepts ('antecedents'). In psycholinguistic theories, anaphor comprehension involves the initial activation of the antecedent and its subsequent integration into the unfolding representation of the narrated event. A recent proposal suggests that these processes draw upon the brain's recognition memory and language networks, respectively, and may be dissociable in patterns of neural oscillatory synchronization (Nieuwland & Martin, 2017). We addressed this proposal in an electroencephalogram (EEG) study with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, using event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Dutch participants read two-sentence mini stories containing proper names, which were repeated or new (ease of activation) and semantically coherent or incoherent with the preceding discourse (ease of integration). Repeated names elicited smaller N400 and Late Positive Component amplitude than new names, and also an increase in theta-band (4-7 Hz) synchronization, which was largest around 240-450 ms after name onset. Discourse-coherent names elicited an increase in gamma-band (60-80 Hz) synchronization compared to discourse-incoherent names. This effect was largest around 690-1000 ms after name onset and exploratory beamformer analysis suggested a left frontal source. We argue that the initial activation and subsequent discourse-level integration of referents can be dissociated with event-related EEG activity, and are associated with respectively theta- and gamma-band activity. These findings further establish the link between memory and language through neural oscillations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hintz, F; Meyer, AS; Huettig, F				Hintz, Florian; Meyer, Antje S.; Huettig, Falk			Activating words beyond the unfolding sentence: Contributions of event simulation and word associations to discourse reading	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Discourse reading; ERPs; Associations; Event simulation	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; PROCESSING PREDICTION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; PROACTIVE BRAIN; LEVEL CONTEXT; KNOWLEDGE; MEMORY; N400	Previous studies have shown that during comprehension readers activate words beyond the unfolding sentence. An open question concerns the mechanisms underlying this behavior. One proposal is that readers mentally simulate the described event and activate related words that might be referred to as the discourse further unfolds. Another proposal is that activation between words spreads in an automatic, associative fashion. The empirical support for these proposals is mixed. Therefore, theoretical accounts differ with regard to how much weight they place on the contributions of these sources to sentence comprehension. In the present study, we attempted to assess the contributions of event simulation and lexical associations to discourse reading, using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants read target words, which were preceded by associatively related words either appearing in a coherent discourse event (Experiment 1) or in sentences that did not form a coherent discourse event (Experiment 2). Contextually unexpected target words that were associatively related to the described events elicited a reduced N400 amplitude compared to contextually unexpected target words that were unrelated to the events (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, a similar but reduced effect was observed. These findings support the notion that during discourse reading event simulation and simple word associations jointly contribute to language comprehension by activating words that are beyond contextually congruent sentence continuations.

This so-called Foreign Language Effect (FLE) has been found in many language pairs when tested with artificial, sacrificial moral dilemmas (i.e., Trolley and Footbridge). In Experiment 1, we investigated whether the FLE can be replicated in Turkish (native) - English (foreign) bilinguals using the same dilemmas (N = 203). These unrealistic and decontextualized dilemmas have been criticized for providing low external validity. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we (1) tested bilinguals with realistic scenarios which included the protagonist's age as a source of identity (child, adult, neutral), and (2) investigated the FLE in these scenarios (N = 467). Our results revealed that the FLE was not present in Turkish-English bilinguals, tested either on sacrificial dilemmas or realistic scenarios. Psychological distance of the scenarios, protagonists' age and the perceived age similarity with the protagonist affected moral judgments.

Increased speech intensity and larger mouth movements are used to overcome noise in constrained settings (the Lombard effect). How we adapt to noise in face-to-face interaction, the natural environment of human language use, where manual gestures are ubiquitous, is currently unknown. We asked Dutch adults to wear headphones with varying levels of multi-talker babble while attempting to communicate action verbs to one another. Using quantitative motion capture and acoustic analyses, we found that (1) noise is associated with increased speech intensity and enhanced gesture kinematics and mouth movements, and (2) acoustic modulation only occurs when gestures are not present, while kinematic modulation occurs regardless of co-occurring speech. Thus, in face-to-face encounters the Lombard effect is not constrained to speech but is a multimodal phenomenon where the visual channel carries most of the communicative burden.

We investigated mental simulation of odors and sounds in two experiments. Participants retained a word while they smelled an odor or heard a sound, then rated odor/sound intensity and recalled the word. Later odor/sound recognition was also tested, and pleasantness and familiarity judgments were collected. Word recall was slower when the sound and sound-word mismatched (e.g., bee sound with the word typhoon). Sound recognition was higher when sounds were paired with a match or near-match word (e.g., bee sound with bee or buzzer). This indicates sound-words are mentally simulated. However, using the same paradigm no memory effects were observed for odor. Instead it appears odor-words only affect lexical-semantic representations, demonstrated by higher ratings of odor intensity and pleasantness when an odor was paired with a match or near-match word (e.g., peach odor with peach or mango). These results suggest fundamental differences in how odor and sound-words are represented.

Using Text Mining Techniques to Identify Health Care Providers With Patient Safety Problems: Exploratory Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						text mining; risk management; health care quality improvement	QUALITY-OF-CARE; COMPLAINTS; DOCTORS	Background: Regulatory bodies such as health care inspectorates can identify potential patient safety problems in health care providers by analyzing patient complaints. However, it is challenging to analyze the large number of complaints. Text mining techniques may help identify signals of problems with patient safety at health care providers. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore whether employing text mining techniques on patient complaint databases can help identify potential problems with patient safety at health care providers and automatically predict the severity of patient complaints. Methods: We performed an exploratory study on the complaints database of the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate with more than 22,000 written complaints. Severe complaints are defined as those cases where the inspectorate contact point experts deemed it worthy of a triage by the inspectorate, or complaints that led to direct action by the inspectorate. We investigated a range of supervised machine learning techniques to assign a severity label to complaints that can be used to prioritize which incoming complaints need the most attention. We studied several features based on the complaints' written content, including sentiment analysis, to decide which were helpful for severity prediction. Finally, we showcased how we could combine these severity predictions and automatic keyword analysis on the complaints database and listed health care providers and their organization-specific complaints to determine the average severity of complaints per organization. Results: A straightforward text classification approach using a bag-of-words feature representation worked best for the severity prediction of complaints. We obtained an accuracy of 87%-93% (2658-2990 of 3319 complaints) on the held-out test set and an F1 score of 45%-51% on the severe complaints. The skewed class distribution led to only reasonable recall (47%-54%) and precision (44%-49%) scores. The use of sentiment analysis for severity prediction was not helpful. By combining the predicted severity outcomes with an automatic keyword analysis, we identified several health care providers that could have patient safety problems. Conclusions: Text mining techniques for analyzing complaints by civilians can support inspectorates. They can automatically predict the severity of the complaints, or they can be used for keyword analysis. This can help the inspectorate detect potential patient safety problems, or support prioritizing follow-up supervision activities by sorting complaints based on the severity per organization or per sector.

Engagement with narrative characters: the role of social-cognitive abilities and linguistic viewpoint	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article; Early Access							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; EMPATHY; IDENTIFICATION; IMPACT; RELIABILITY; PERSPECTIVE; VALIDATION; SIMULATION; SIMILARITY	This article explores the role of text and reader characteristics in character engagement experiences. In an online study, participants completed several self-report and behavioral measures of social-cognitive abilities and read two literary narratives in which the presence of linguistic viewpoint markers was varied using a highly controlled manipulation strategy. Afterward, participants reported on their character engagement experiences. A principal component analysis on participants' responses revealed the multidimensional nature of character engagement, which included both self- and other-oriented emotional responses (e.g., empathy, personal distress) as well as more cognitive responses (e.g., identification, perspective taking). Furthermore, character engagement was found to rely on a wide range of social-cognitive abilities but not on the presence of viewpoint markers. Finally, and most importantly, we did not find convincing evidence for an interplay between social-cognitive abilities and the presence of viewpoint markers. These findings suggest that readers rely on their social-cognitive abilities to engage with the inner worlds of fictional others, more so than on the lexical cues of those inner worlds provided by the text.

Using a novel paradigm for approximating naturalistic (but not necessarily non-intentional) L2 learning in the lab, German learners of Dutch were led to believe that the study concerned judging the price of objects. Dutch target words (object names) were selected individually such that these words were unknown to the respective participant. Then, in a dialogue-like task with the experimenter, the participants were first exposed to and then tested on the target words. In comparison to a no-input control group, we observed a clear learning effect especially from the first two exposures, and better learning for cognates than for non-cognates, but no modulating effect of the exposure-production lag. Moreover, some of the acquired knowledge persisted over a six-month period.

J	Savinova, E; Sanders, T; Mak, P				Savinova, Elena; Sanders, Ted; Mak, Pim			A multi-method approach to estimating subjectivity of causal connectives: The case of 'poetomu' and 'tak chto' in Russian	LINGUA			English	Article; Early Access						Subjectivity; Causality; Russian connectives; Discourse types	COHERENCE RELATIONS; LANGUAGE; MANDARIN; CORPUS; DUTCH	Cross-linguistic evidence shows that languages often employ specialized causal connectives to express subjective versus objective relations. This evidence mostly comes from corpus studies. However, the phenomenon of connective specialization can also be approached with experimental methods. The present study set out to compare different methods of investigating subjectivity profiles of causal connectives in a language, uncovering the different aspects of connective specialization that they elucidate. A combination of the traditional corpus analysis (Study 1), a connective insertion experiment (Study 2), and a sentence continuation experiment (Study 3) was applied to Russian forward causal connectives poetomu 'that's why' and tak chto 'so', which have not been studied in this respect. The results of all three methods show that, across discourse types, tak chto prefers subjective relations more than poetomu, which expresses objective relations. The specialization of connectives is most pronounced in the connective insertion experiment due to the constraining nature of this task and the prototypicality of the stimuli. The corpus study and the sentence continuation experiment show less strong specialization profiles of connectives because they are more sensitive to other contextual factors. Our research illustrates the importance of combining different methods and contributes to the cross-linguistic research in the field. (C) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article; Early Access						Limited health literacy; Primary care physiotherapy; Communication	PHYSICIAN-PATIENT COMMUNICATION; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION; THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE; HEART-FAILURE; OUTCOMES; INFORMATION; EDUCATION; BELIEFS; ABILITY	Objectives: Research shows that health professionals should adapt their communication when addressing patients with limited health literacy (HL). However, the extent to which physiotherapists apply recommended commu-nication techniques is unclear.Methods: We conducted a two phase mixed-method study, first holding focus group interviews among patients and experts on communication to explore the need for adjusted communication in physiotherapist-patient interaction. Second, we manually coded audio recordings of primary care physiotherapy consultations to investigate the extent to which physiotherapists applied these recommended communication techniques, and adjusted their communication towards patients with lower education.Results: Focus group interviews identified four categories of communication elements: the teach-back method, medical jargon explanation, summarizing patient's narratives, and checking patient's understanding. In 50 audio recordings we identified 2670 clauses. We report limited use of the recommended communication techniques; the teach-back method was used in 2% of consultations (95%CI: 0.4%-10.5%) while medical jargon explanation was used in 84% (95%CI: 71.5%-91.7%). Mixed effects logistic regression models showed no association be-tween lower education and communication techniques.Conclusion: Although physiotherapists need to adjust their communication to patients with lower education, they rarely apply the recommended communication techniques. Practice implications: Knowledge about limited HL among physiotherapists needs to be increased.	[van der Scheer-Horst, Ellis; Rutten, Geert; Borkent, Jos; Staal, J.

Participants listened to long stretches (4 - 15 min) of naturalistic speech from different registers (dialogues, news broadcasts, and read-aloud books), totalling approximately 50,000 words, while the EEG signal was recorded. We estimated the surprisal of words in the speech materials with the aid of a statistical language model in such a manner that it reflected different predictive processing strategies; generic, register-specific, or recency-based. The N400 amplitude was best predicted with register-specific word surprisal, indicating that the statistics of the wider context (i.e., register) influences predictive language processing. Furthermore, adaptation to speech register cannot merely be explained by recency effects; instead, listeners adapt their word anticipations to the presented speech register.	[Bentum, M.; Bosch, L.

Reading Minds, Reading Stories: Social-Cognitive Abilities Affect the Linguistic Processing of Narrative Viewpoint	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						social cognition; narrative; viewpoint; perspective; eye tracking	EYE-MOVEMENTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; WORD-LENGTH; EMPATHY; SIMULATION; LANGUAGE; FICTION; VERSION; COMPREHENSION	Although various studies have shown that narrative reading draws on social-cognitive abilities, not much is known about the precise aspects of narrative processing that engage these abilities. We hypothesized that the linguistic processing of narrative viewpoint-expressed by elements that provide access to the inner world of characters-might play an important role in engaging social-cognitive abilities. Using eye tracking, we studied the effect of lexical markers of perceptual, cognitive, and emotional viewpoint on eye movements during reading of a 5,000-word narrative. Next, we investigated how this relationship was modulated by individual differences in social-cognitive abilities. Our results show diverging patterns of eye movements for perceptual viewpoint markers on the one hand, and cognitive and emotional viewpoint markers on the other. Whereas the former are processed relatively fast compared to non-viewpoint markers, the latter are processed relatively slow. Moreover, we found that social-cognitive abilities impacted the processing of words in general, and of perceptual and cognitive viewpoint markers in particular, such that both perspective-taking abilities and self-reported perspective-taking traits facilitated the processing of these markers. All in all, our study extends earlier findings that social cognition is of importance for story reading, showing that individual differences in social-cognitive abilities are related to the linguistic processing of narrative viewpoint.

Two online experiments were carried out in which participants judged the strength of (un)intensified positive and negative evaluations in written dialogues. Both studies showed intensified language was perceived as stronger than unmarked language (i.e., language that was not intensified), and negative evaluations were stronger than positive evaluations. What is more, intensification and polarity interact; the increment of perceived strength for intensified positive adjectives (Study 1) and purely intensified adverbs (really, very; Study 2) was bigger than the increment in perceived strength of intensified negative adjective and adverbs. When a meaningful intensifier (deliciously, disgustingly) was used, the negativity effect remained. The findings were discussed within cognitive frameworks such as relevance theory, theory of mind, and theory on verbal aggression.

J	Unsworth, S; Chondrogianni, V; Skarabela, B				Unsworth, Sharon; Chondrogianni, Vicky; Skarabela, Barbora			Experiential Measures Can Be Used as a Proxy for Language Dominance in Bilingual Language Acquisition Research	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						language dominance; language exposure; language use; bilingual children; relative proficiency	PAST TENSE; ENGLISH; EXPOSURE; VOCABULARY; CHILDREN; INPUT	Language dominance is a multidimensional construct comprising several distinct yet interrelated components, including language proficiency, exposure and use. The exact relation between these components remains unclear. Several studies have observed a (non-linear) relationship between bilingual children's amount of exposure and absolute proficiency in each language, but our understanding of the relationship between language exposure and use and relative proficiency is limited. To address this question, we examined whether experiential-based measures of language dominance, operationalised here in the narrow sense of relative language proficiency, can provide an efficient alternative to the more labor-intensive performance-based measures often used in the literature. In earlier work, Unsworth (2016a) examined the relationship between relative proficiency and language exposure and use in a group of English-Dutch bilingual preschool children residing in the Netherlands. This study expands these findings by examining Dutch-English preschool children of the same age residing in the United Kingdom in order to cover the full dominance continuum. Participants were 35 simultaneous bilingual children (2; 0-5; 0) exposed to English and Dutch, 20 resident in the Netherlands and 15 in the United Kingdom. Relative amount of language exposure and use were estimated using a parental questionnaire. To obtain performance-based measures of language proficiency, children's spontaneous speech was recorded during a half-hour play session in each language. The transcribed data were used to derive MLU (words), average length of the longest five utterances, the number of different verb and noun types. Single word vocabulary comprehension was assessed using standardized tests in both languages. Following Yip and Matthews (2006), relative proficiency was operationalised using differentials. In line with Unsworth (2016a), English-dominant children typically had less than approx. 35% exposure to Dutch and used Dutch less than approximately 30% of the time. Curve-fitting analyses revealed that non-linear models best fit the data. Logistic regression analyses showed that both exposure and use were good predictors of dominance group membership assigned using the same approach as Unsworth (2016a), that is, using SDs. Dominance groups derived independently using cluster analyses overlapped with the groups derived using SDs, confirming that relative amount of exposure and use can be used as a proxy for language dominance.

Children's responses to the exhibition, with particular attention to their olfactory perceptions of the odors at the exhibition, were solicited through researcher-child interviews and children's drawings. Responses from 28 children (girls N = 14, boys N = 14) aged between 4.5-8 years were analyzed after they visited the exhibition using the cross-modal association and multisensory theories. Interview data showed that dark (brown and black) colors elicited children's negative olfactory associations for both positive and negative odors. Children's drawings did not seem to make references to the odors at the exhibitions but rather their preferences for the different story characters. We theorize about the associations between smell and colors in children's responses and distil some key learnings for multisensory museology.

To facilitate research into the encoding of emotion in language and how emotion associations affect language processing, we present a new set of emotion norms for over 24,000 Dutch words. The emotion norms include ratings of two key dimensions of emotion: valence and arousal, as well as ratings on discrete emotion categories: happiness, anger, fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise. We show that emotional information can predict word processing, such that responses to positive words are facilitated in contrast to neutral and negative words. We also demonstrate how the ratings of emotion are related to personality characteristics. The data are available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/9htuv/) and serve as a valuable resource for research into emotion as well as in applied settings such as healthcare and digital communication.

Evidence from emerging sign languages suggests that phonological structure emerges gradually in a new language. In this study, we investigate variation in the form of signs across 20 deaf adult signers of Kata Kolok, a sign language that emerged spontaneously in a Balinese village community. Combining methods previously used for sign comparisons, we introduce a new numeric measure of variation. Our nuanced yet comprehensive approach to form variation integrates three levels (iconic motivation, surface realisation, feature differences) and allows for refinement through weighting the variation score by token and signer frequency. We demonstrate that variation in the form of signs appears in different degrees at different levels. Token frequency in a given dataset greatly affects how much variation can surface, suggesting caution in interpreting previous findings. Different sign variants have different scopes of use among the signing population, with some more widely used than others. Both frequency weightings (token and signer) identify dominant sign variants, i.e., sign forms that are produced frequently or by many signers. We argue that variation does not equal the absence of conventionalisation. Indeed, especially in micro-community sign languages, variation may be key to understanding patterns of language emergence.

While the importance of considering context for understanding cognition has long been recognized in psychology and philosophy, it has not yet had much impact on cognitive neuroscience research, where cognition is often studied in decontextualized paradigms. Here, we present examples of recent studies showing that context changes the neural basis of diverse cognitive processes, including perception, attention, memory, and language. Within the domains of perception and language, we review neuroimaging results showing that context interacts with stimulus processing, changes activity in classical perception and language regions, and recruits additional brain regions that contribute crucially to naturalistic perception and language. We discuss how contextualized cognitive neuroscience will allow for discovering new principles of the mind and brain.

These are also morphologically complex forms. It is debated whether modality-specific aspects of spatial expressions modulate spatial language development differently in signing compared to speaking children. In a picture description task, we compared the use of locative expressions for containment, support, and occlusion relations by deaf children acquiring Turkish Sign Language and hearing children acquiring Turkish (age 3;5-9;11). Unlike previous reports suggesting a boosting effect of iconicity, and/or a hindering effect of morphological complexity of the locative forms in sign languages, our results show similar developmental patterns for signing and speaking children's acquisition of these forms. Our results suggest the primacy of cognitive development guiding the acquisition of locative expressions by speaking and signing children.

In this paper, the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data is discussed. Tweets in Turkish language from the Aegean Region of Turkey were used for the study. It is aimed to form a smart system, which detects problems of citizens and extracts the problems' exact locations from tweet texts. Firstly, the collected data was analyzed to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem. After the possibility of detecting tweets, which have any city problem, was ensured, two datasets were created. The first one consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem and the second one has the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of the classifier is given. A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely. The first findings of the project is promising. The high accuracy, which is obtained by the classifier, shows that it is proper to use this classifier for our study. The location recognizer is planned to be improved and place names on the real-time tweet data is to be detected.

J	Huisman, JLA; Majid, A				Huisman, John L. A.; Majid, Asifa			Psycholinguistic variables matter in odor naming	MEMORY & COGNITION			English	Article						Olfaction; Olfactory naming; Word frequency; Semantic interference	SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST; WORD-FREQUENCY; SEMANTIC INTERFERENCE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; AGE; ACQUISITION; PICTURES; SPEECH; LANGUAGE; VALIDITY	People from Western societies generally find it difficult to name odors. In trying to explain this, the olfactory literature has proposed several theories that focus heavily on properties of the odor itself but rarely discuss properties of the label used to describe it. However, recent studies show speakers of languages with dedicated smell lexicons can name odors with relative ease. Has the role of the lexicon been overlooked in the olfactory literature? Word production studies show properties of the label, such as word frequency and semantic context, influence naming; but this field of research focuses heavily on the visual domain. The current study combines methods from both fields to investigate word production for olfaction in two experiments. In the first experiment, participants named odors whose veridical labels were either high-frequency or low-frequency words in Dutch, and we found that odors with high-frequency labels were named correctly more often. In the second experiment, edibility was used for manipulating semantic context in search of a semantic interference effect, presenting the odors in blocks of edible and inedible odor source objects to half of the participants. While no evidence was found for a semantic interference effect, an effect of word frequency was again present. Our results demonstrate psycholinguistic variables-such as word frequency-are relevant for olfactory naming, and may, in part, explain why it is difficult to name odors in certain languages.

J	Eekhof, LS; Mar, RA				Eekhof, Lynn S.; Mar, Raymond A.			Does reading about fictional minds make us more curious about real ones?	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article; Early Access						social curiosity; narrative fiction; expository texts; reading; social cognition	SOCIAL COGNITION; EMPATHIC ACCURACY; LITERARY FICTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SIMULATION; EXPOSURE; LANGUAGE; NETWORK; HELPS	Although there is a large body of research assessing whether exposure to narratives boosts social cognition immediately afterward, not much research has investigated the underlying mechanism of this putative effect. This experiment investigates the possibility that reading a narrative increases social curiosity directly afterward, which might explain the short-term boosts in social cognition reported by some others. We developed a novel measure of state social curiosity and collected data from participants (N = 222) who were randomly assigned to read an excerpt of narrative fiction or expository nonfiction. Contrary to our expectations, we found that those who read a narrative exhibited less social curiosity afterward than those who read an expository text. This result was not moderated by trait social curiosity. An exploratory analysis uncovered that the degree to which texts present readers with social targets predicted less social curiosity. Our experiment demonstrates that reading narratives, or possibly texts with social content in general, may engage and fatigue social-cognitive abilities, causing a temporary decrease in social curiosity. Such texts might also temporarily satisfy the need for social connection, temporarily reducing social curiosity. Both accounts are in line with theories describing how narratives result in better social cognition over the long term.

In this study, we investigated how the order in which different types of panels in visual sequences are presented affects how the unfolding narrative is comprehended. Participants viewed short comic strips while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. We analyzed evoked and induced EEG activity elicited by both full panels (showing a full character) and refiner panels (showing only a zoom of that full panel), and took into account whether they preceded or followed the panel to which they were co-referentially related (i.e., were cataphoric or anaphoric). We found that full panels elicited both larger N300 amplitude and increased gamma-band power compared to refiner panels. Anaphoric panels elicited a sustained negativity compared to cataphoric panels, which appeared to be sensitive to the referential status of the anaphoric panel. In the time-frequency domain, anaphoric panels elicited reduced 8-12 Hz alpha power and increased 45-65 Hz gamma-band power compared to cataphoric panels. These findings are consistent with models in which the processes involved in visual narrative comprehension partially overlap with those in language comprehension.

However, only few corpus studies with a constructionist background take this multi-level nature fully into account. In this paper, we argue that understanding language variation can be advanced considerably by systematically formulating and testing hypotheses at various levels in the constructional network. To illustrate the approach, we present a corpus study of the Dutch naar-alternation. It is found that this alternation primarily functions at an intermediate level in the constructional network.

Recent research has shown that users of an established sign language such as LIS (Italian Sign Language) use simultaneous and iconic constructions as a modality-specific resource to achieve communicative efficiency when they are required to encode informationally rich events. However, it remains to be explored whether the use of such simultaneous and iconic constructions recruited for communicative efficiency can be employed even without a linguistic system (i.e., in silent gesture) or whether they are specific to linguistic patterning (i.e., in LIS). In the present study, we conducted the same experiment as in Slonimska et al. with 23 Italian speakers using silent gesture and compared the results of the two studies. The findings showed that while simultaneity was afforded by the visual modality to some extent, its use in silent gesture was nevertheless less frequent and qualitatively different than when used within a linguistic system. Thus, the use of simultaneous and iconic constructions for communicative efficiency constitutes an emergent property of sign languages. The present study highlights the importance of studying modality-specific resources and their use for linguistic expression in order to promote a more thorough understanding of the language faculty and its modality-specific adaptive capabilities.

One approach uses a single multi-class classifier with the full dataset that includes eleven modal verbs; the other builds different classifiers, one for each verb. The performance is measured using precision, recall and F-1. Due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset a weighted average approach was calculated for each metric. We use support vector machines as our classifier and experimented with various SVM kernels to find the optimal classifier for the task at hand. We experimented with several different types of feature attributes representing parse tree information and compare these complex feature representation against a simple bag-of-words feature representation as baseline. The best obtained F-1 values are above 0.60 and from the results it is possible to conclude that there is no significant difference between both approaches.

Participants read one of eight versions of a newspaper article followed by measures on risk perceptions, negative affect, behavioral intentions, and perceived sensationalism. Risk perceptions and fear were primarily driven by objective risk characteristics, whereas emotion-laden news form only increased perceptions of disease severity, not of fear or personal vulnerability.

However, it is unknown how non-native listeners neurally integrate speech and gestures, as they might process visual semantic context differently than natives. We recorded EEG while native and highly-proficient non-native listeners watched videos of an actress uttering an action verb in clear or degraded speech, accompanied by a matching (to drive' + driving gesture) or mismatching gesture ('to drink' + mixing gesture). Degraded speech elicited an enhanced N400 amplitude compared to clear speech in both groups, revealing an increase in neural resources needed to resolve the spoken input. A larger N400 effect was found in clear speech for non natives compared to natives, but in degraded speech only for natives. Non-native listeners might thus process gesture more strongly than natives when speech is clear, but need more auditory cues to facilitate access to gestural semantic information when speech is degraded.

J	Sümer, B; Özyürek, A				Sumer, Beyza; Ozyurek, Asli			Cross-modal investigation of event component omissions in language development: a comparison of signing and speaking children	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Language acquisition; motion; sign language; spoken language; language modality	SPATIAL LANGUAGE; MOTION EVENTS; ENGLISH; MANNER; PATH	Language development research suggests a universal tendency for children to be under- informative in narrating motion events by omitting components such as Path, Manner or Ground. However, this assumption has not been tested for children acquiring sign language. Due to the affordances of the visual-spatial modality of sign languages for iconic expression, signing children might omit event components less frequently than speaking children. Here we analysed motion event descriptions elicited from deaf children (4-10 years) acquiring Turkish Sign Language (TID) and their Turkish-speaking peers. While children omitted all types of event components more often than adults, signing children and adults encoded more Path and Manner in TID than their peers in Turkish. These results provide more evidence for a general universal tendency for children to omit event components as well as a modality bias for sign languages to encode both Manner and Path more frequently than spoken languages.

We tested how highly proficient non-native listeners benefit from these visual articulators compared to native listeners. We presented videos of an actress uttering a verb in clear, moderately, or severely degraded speech, while her lips were blurred, visible, or visible and accompanied by a gesture. Our results revealed that unlike native listeners, non-native listeners were less likely to benefit from the combined enhancement of visible speech and gestures, especially since the benefit from visible speech was minimal when the signal quality was not sufficient.

The Relation Between Autistic Traits, the Degree of Synaesthesia, and Local/Global Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism; Synaesthesia; Synesthesia; Neurotypical; Visual perception; Local; global	WEAK CENTRAL COHERENCE; EMBEDDED FIGURES TEST; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; COLOR; PERFORMANCE; SYNESTHESIA; ATTENTION; DISORDER; CHILDREN	Synaesthesia is highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder. We assessed the relation between the degree of autistic traits (Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ) and the degree of synaesthesia in a neurotypical population, and hypothesized both are related to a local bias in visual perception. A positive correlation between total AQ scores and the degree of synaesthesia was found, extending previous studies in clinical populations. Consistent with our hypothesis, AQ-attention to detail scores were related to increased performance on an Embedded Figures Task and reduced susceptibility to visual illusions. We found no relation between autistic traits and performance on a motion coherence task, and no relation between synaesthesia and local visual perception. Possibly, this relation is reserved for supra-threshold synaesthetes.

In order to facilitate research on language and the senses, large sets of linguistic stimuli and their corresponding measures of sensory associations should be available. To aid in such investigations, we present a new set of sensory modality norms for over 24,000 Dutch words. The sensory norms comprise perceptual strength ratings in six perceptual modalities: audition, gustation, haptics, olfaction, vision, and interoception. The new norms improve on existing Dutch sensory norms in three ways: 1) they significantly expand on the number of words rated; 2) they include multiple word classes; 3) they add a new perceptual modality: interoception. We show that the sensory norms are able to predict word processing behavior and outperform existing ratings of sensory experience: concreteness and imageability. The data are available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ubvy2) and serve as a valuable resource for research into the relationship between language and perception.

J	Zhou, WC; Broersma, M; Cutler, A				Zhou, Wencui; Broersma, Mirjam; Cutler, Anne			Asymmetric memory for birth language perception versus production in young international adoptees	COGNITION			English	Article						Adoption; Language retention; Speech perception; Speech production; Segments; Lexical tones	EARLY BILINGUALISM; ACQUISITION; DISCRIMINATION; IMITATION; PHONOLOGY; ENGLISH; SPANISH	Adults who as children were adopted into a different linguistic community retain knowledge of their birth language. The possession (without awareness) of such knowledge is known to facilitate the (re)learning of birthlanguage speech patterns; this perceptual learning predicts such adults' production success as well, indicating that the retained linguistic knowledge is abstract in nature. Adoptees' acquisition of their adopted language is fast and complete; birth-language mastery disappears rapidly, although this latter process has been little studied. Here, 46 international adoptees from China aged four to 10 years, with Dutch as their new language, plus 47 matched non-adopted Dutch-native controls and 40 matched non-adopted Chinese controls, undertook across a two-week period 10 blocks of training in perceptually identifying Chinese speech contrasts (one segmental, one tonal) which were unlike any Dutch contrasts. Chinese controls easily accomplished all these tasks. The same participants also provided speech production data in an imitation task. In perception, adoptees and Dutch controls scored equivalently poorly at the outset of training; with training, the adoptees significantly improved while the Dutch controls did not. In production, adoptees' imitations both before and after training could be better identified, and received higher goodness ratings, than those of Dutch controls. The perception results confirm that birth-language knowledge is stored and can facilitate re-learning in post-adoption childhood; the production results suggest that although processing of phonological category detail appears to depend on access to the stored knowledge, general articulatory dimensions can at this age also still be remembered, and may facilitate spoken imitation.

The core meanings of toch, wel and eigenlijk are formally distinguished on the basis of two intersubjective parameters: (i) whether the particle marks alignment or misalignment between speaker and addressee discourse beliefs, and (ii) whether the particle requires an assessment of the addressee's representation of mutual discourse beliefs. By means of a quantitative corpus study, we investigate to what extent the intersubjective meaning distinctions between wel, toch and eigenlijk are reflected in statistical usage patterns across different social situations. Results suggest that wel, toch and eigenlijk are lexicalizations of distinct generalized politeness strategies when expressing contrast in social interaction. Our findings call for an interdisciplinary approach to discourse particles in order to enhance our understanding of their functions in language.

Synaesthesia is highly prevalent among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the mechanisms of this co-occurrence are not clear. We hypothesized autism and synaesthesia share atypical sensory sensitivity and perception. We assessed autistic traits, sensory sensitivity and visual perception in two synaesthete populations. In Study 1, synaesthetes (N = 79, of different types) scored higher than non-synaesthetes (N = 76) on the Attention-to-detail and Social skills subscales of the autism spectrum quotient indexing autistic traits, and on the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire indexing sensory hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity which frequently occur in autism. Synaesthetes performed two local/global visual tasks because individuals with autism typically show a bias towards detail processing. In synaesthetes, elevated motion coherence thresholds (MCTs) suggested reduced global motion perception, and higher accuracy on an embedded figures task suggested enhanced local perception. In Study 2, sequence-space synaesthetes (N = 18) completed the same tasks. Questionnaire and embedded figures results qualitatively resembled Study 1 results, but no significant group differences with non-synaesthetes (N = 20) were obtained. Unexpectedly, sequence-space synaesthetes had reduced MCTs. Altogether, our studies suggest atypical sensory sensitivity and a bias towards detail processing are shared features of synaesthesia and ASD.

An empirical study with repeated measures investigated the effects of reading a funny Johnny Joker narrative, in which a negative role model tries out various behaviors related to tooth brushing, on attitudes and intentions towards tooth brushing of 37 toddlers. Narrative processes of wishful identification, media enjoyment and parasocial interaction were measured at ti. Analyses showed that toddlers' attitudes and intentions became more positive after hearing the story three times. Parasocial interaction (and not media enjoyment and wishful identification) significantly predicted attitudes towards tooth brushing. Findings suggest that the narrative with the negative role model may have persuaded children towards healthy lifestyles because the character felt like a (naughty) friend that they liked but did not want to resemble.

These studies revealed that professionals may use empathy displays not only to validate the client's worry, but also to perform actions oriented to other institutional goals and tasks such as closing off a troubles-telling sequence. In this article, we present an analysis of empathically designed responses in Dutch telephone counseling. The data consist of 36 calls from the Alcohol and Drugs Info Line. In some of the calls, clients' troubles-telling includes emotion discourse', that is, descriptions of their feelings/emotions. Counselors may respond to these descriptions using conventional empathy displays like I can imagine that' and I understand that' in a range of verbal and prosodic variations. The analysis reveals that these responses open up advice sequences that vary in the extent to which they treat the client's articulated feelings as valid. Most are affiliating, treating the client's feelings as the basis for advice, while some are less affiliative, putting the client's feelings into perspective or implicitly questioning their legitimacy. Hence, empathically designed responses are pivots to advice-giving.

Knowing the entire story - a focus group study on patient experiences with chronic Lyme-associated symptoms (chronic Lyme disease)	BMC PRIMARY CARE			English	Article						Lyme disease; Chronic Lyme disease; Focus group; Patient perspective; Narrative analysis; Health communication	MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS; SUPPORT GROUPS; DIAGNOSIS; CANCER	Background Healthcare providers frequently struggle to provide effective care to patients with chronic Lyme-associated symptoms (chronic Lyme disease, CLD), potentially causing these patients to feel misunderstood or neglected by the healthcare system. This study is the first to use a combined medical and communication science approach, and aims to assess patients' experiences with CLD & CLD-related care, identify themes and repertories in these patients' narrations, and provide potential ways to improve communication with them. Methods Informed by the principles of 'clean language', we conducted focus groups with self-identified CLD patients (N = 15). We asked participants about their experiences with CLD and CLD-related healthcare. We performed thematic analyses using a bottom-up approach based in discourse analysis. We also sought to identify specific types of verbalizations (repertoires) across themes. Results Participants thematised a heterogeneous set of CLD-associated symptoms, which they frequently labelled as 'invisible' to others. Their illness significantly affected their daily lives, impacting their work, social activities, relationships with loved ones, hobbies and other means of participating in society. Negative experiences with healthcare providers were near-universal, also in patients with short-lived CLD-associated symptoms. Verbalizations were notable for frequent use of communicative modes that implicitly create common ground between participants and that give a certain validity to personal experiences (impersonal 'you' and other forms of presupposition). Conclusion Central themes found in CLD patients' communication are 1. the experience of significant symptoms, 2. for which adequate relief is only rarely found from conventional medical practitioners, and 3. that are largely invisible to the outside world. Verbalizing these themes, patients use various repertoires for their shared experiences, such as a feeling of abandonment or not being heard by the medical system, feelings of loss with respect to their previous health, and the idea that they might have been better off had they been diagnosed sooner. Working with these repertoires will enable healthcare providers to establish a shared perspective with their CLD patients, thus engaging in more fruitful doctor-patient communication.

Hierarchical Structure in Language and Action: A Formal Comparison	PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint Conference on Language Evolution	SEP 05-08, 2022	Kanazawa, JAPAN			hierarchy; syntax; compositionality; formal modeling; set theory	BROCAS AREA; SYNTAX; ORGANIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FACULTY; ARCHITECTURE; SIMILARITY; PERCEPTION; EVOLUTION; MODELS	Since the cognitive revolution, language and action have been compared as cognitive systems, with cross-domain convergent views recently gaining renewed interest in biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Language and action are both combinatorial systems whose mode of combination has been argued to be hierarchical, combining elements into constituents of increasingly larger size. This structural similarity has led to the suggestion that they rely on shared cognitive and neural resources. In this article, we compare the conceptual and formal properties of hierarchy in language and action using set theory. We show that the strong compositionality of language requires a particular formalism, a magma, to describe the algebraic structure corresponding to the set of hierarchical structures underlying sentences. When this formalism is applied to actions, it appears to be both too strong and too weak. To overcome these limitations, which are related to the weak compositionality and sequential nature of action structures, we formalize the algebraic structure corresponding to the set of actions as a trace monoid. We aim to capture the different system properties of language and action in terms of the distinction between hierarchical sets and hierarchical sequences and discuss the implications for the way both systems could be represented in the brain.

Not When But Whether: Modality and Future Time Reference in English and Dutch	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Future time reference; Psychological discounting; Modality; Future tense; Linguistic relativity; Linguistic savings hypothesis	DELAY; PROBABILITY; TENSE; LANGUAGES; BEHAVIOR; RATES; PERSPECTIVE; PERCEPTION; SEMANTICS; FRAMEWORK	Previous research on linguistic relativity and economic decisions hypothesized that speakers of languages with obligatory tense marking of future time reference (FTR) should value future rewards less than speakers of languages which permit present tense FTR. This was hypothesized on the basis of obligatory linguistic marking (e.g., will) causing speakers to construe future events as more temporally distal and thereby to exhibit increased "temporal discounting": the subjective devaluation of outcomes as the delay until they will occur increases. However, several aspects of this hypothesis are incomplete. First, it overlooks the role of "modal" FTR structures which encode notions about the likelihood of future outcomes (e.g., might). This may influence "probability discounting": the subjective devaluation of outcomes as the probability of their occurrence decreases. Second, the extent to which linguistic structures are subjectively related to temporal or probability discounting differences is currently unknown. To address these, we elicited FTR language and subjective ratings of temporal distance and probability from speakers of English, which exhibits strongly grammaticized FTR, and Dutch, which does not. Several findings went against the predictions of the previous hypothesis: Framing an FTR statement in the present ("Ellie arrives later on") versus the future tense (" horizontal ellipsis will arrive horizontal ellipsis ") did not affect ratings of temporal distance; English speakers rated future statements as relatively more temporally proximal than Dutch speakers; and English and Dutch speakers rated future tenses as encoding high certainty, which suggests that obligatory future tense marking might result in less discounting. Additionally, compared with Dutch speakers, English speakers used more low-certainty terms in general (e.g., may) and as a function of various experimental factors. We conclude that the prior cross-linguistic observations of the link between FTR and psychological discounting may be caused by the connection between low-certainty modal structures and probability discounting, rather than future tense and temporality.

Effective communication requires the addressee to recognize the act as being communicative. Humans are sensitive to ostensive communicative cues, such as direct eye gaze (Csibra & Gergely, 2009). However, there may be additional cues present in the action or gesture itself. Here we investigate features that characterize the initiation of a communicative interaction in both production and comprehension. We asked 40 participants to perform 31 pairs of object-directed actions and representational gestures in more-or less- communicative contexts. Data were collected using motion capture technology for kinematics and video recording for eye-gaze. With these data, we focused on two issues. First, if and how actions and gestures are systematically modulated when performed in a communicative context. Second, if observers exploit such kinematic information to classify an act as communicative. Our study showed that during production the communicative context modulates space-time dimensions of kinematics and elicits an increase in addressee-directed eye-gaze. Naive participants detected communicative intent in actions and gestures preferentially using eye-gaze information, only utilizing kinematic information when eye-gaze was unavailable. Our study highlights the general communicative modulation of action and gesture kinematics during production but also shows that addressees only exploit this modulation to recognize communicative intention in the absence of eye-gaze. We discuss these findings in terms of distinctive but potentially overlapping functions of addressee directed eye-gaze and kinematic modulations within the wider context of human communication and learning.

Effects of Structure and Meaning on Cortical Tracking of Linguistic Units in Naturalistic Speech	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE			English	Article						EEG; mutual information; compositionality; idioms; jabberwocky	ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; PHASE PATTERNS; COMPREHENSION; DELTA; ENTRAINMENT; RESPONSES; INTEGRATION; UNIFICATION	Recent research has established that cortical activity "tracks" the presentation rate of syntactic phrases in continuous speech, even though phrases are abstract units that do not have direct correlates in the acoustic signal. We investigated whether cortical tracking of phrase structures is modulated by the extent to which these structures compositionally determine meaning. To this end, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of 38 native speakers who listened to naturally spoken Dutch stimuli in different conditions, which parametrically modulated the degree to which syntactic structure and lexical semantics determine sentence meaning. Tracking was quantified through mutual information between the EEG data and either the speech envelopes or abstract annotations of syntax, all of which were filtered in the frequency band corresponding to the presentation rate of phrases (1.1-2.1 Hz). Overall, these mutual information analyses showed stronger tracking of phrases in regular sentences than in stimuli whose lexical-syntactic content is reduced, but no consistent differences in tracking between sentences and stimuli that contain a combination of syntactic structure and lexical content. While there were no effects of compositional meaning on the degree of phrase-structure tracking, analyses of event-related potentials elicited by sentence-final words did reveal meaning-induced differences between conditions. Our findings suggest that cortical tracking of structure in sentences indexes the internal generation of this structure, a process that is modulated by the properties of its input, but not by the compositional interpretation of its output.

The cities, which both have multicultural demographic profiles, are located in different dialect areas. In the data, the realization of neuter gender appears to vary greatly; in our analyses of this variation linguistic and social parameters were included. With regard to the language-internal conditioning, grammatical and semantic dimensions have been taken into account. Apart from the speakers' age and city of residence, the social dimensions also include background of both the speaker and the interlocutor. The outcomes shed light on three aspects. As regards conditioning factors, L1 substrates, processes of L2 acquisition of the first generations of migrants, and surrounding regional variation all play a role. As regards the place of ethnolectal variation in the speakers' verbal repertoires, we found evidence for a stylistic role of variable gender assignment in determiners. Our data do not support the hypothesis of the cross-over of ethnolectal changes in Dutch grammatical gender marking to speakers without an immigrant background.

We provide quantitative analyses of the pronunciation variants characterized as segmental sequences and qualitative analyses of the more detailed phonetic characteristics of these variants. Our data demonstrate a wide range of variation in the production of the word, ranging from trisyllabic tokens closely resembling the word's citation form (13% of the tokens) to phonetically minimal monosyllabic tokens consisting merely of a vowel followed by a single obstruent consonant (36%). The full form is thus not the most frequent form. The reduced tokens occur both in prosodically weak and strong positions, contrary to what is typically reported for reduced words. The pronunciation variation displayed by eigenlijk is conditioned, among other factors, by the rhythm of the phrase, and shows large differences between speakers. Importantly, a form may be reduced in one aspect, but not in another. For instance, a bisyllabic form may be as long as a trisyllabic form and, whereas some forms still contain acoustic cues for the /l/ but not for the fricative, this is the other way around for other forms. Generally, we found that every pronunciation variant of eigenlijk includes two landmarks that may be considered to be the main characteristics of the word (the full vowel and a velar/uvular consonant). These findings raise new questions about reduction, including the status of full but infrequent forms, the extent to which reduction is an automatic process, and the role of landmarks in speech processing. We conclude that many aspects of the phenomenon of speech reduction are not yet well understood and call for more detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses of many tokens of individual words produced in casual speech. Like our study, these studies will substantially extend our knowledge about speech reduction and about speech production and perception.

Here, we test whether this extends to spatial settings and is modulated by cognitive abilities. Younger and older adults gave instructions on how to assemble 3Dmodels from building blocks on six consecutive trials. We induced mutually shared knowledge by either showing speaker and addressee the model beforehand, or not. Additionally, shared knowledge accumulated across the trials. Younger and crucially also older adults provided recipient-designed utterances, indicated by a significant reduction in the number of words and of gestures when common ground was present. Additionally, we observed a reduction in semantic content and a shift in cross-modal distribution of information across trials. Rather than age, individual differences in verbal and visual working memory and semantic fluency predicted the extent of addressee-based adaptations. Thus, in spatial tasks, individual cognitive abilities modulate the interactive language use of both younger and older adults.

Locative encodings of late-signing deaf adults varied from those of early-signing deaf adults in the preferred types of linguistic forms. In the current study, we investigated whether such differences would be found in spatial language use of deaf children with deaf parents who are either early or late signers of Turkish Sign Language (TID). We analyzed locative encodings elicited from these two groups of deaf children for the use of different linguistic forms and the types of classifier handshapes. Our findings revealed differences between these two groups of deaf children in their preferred types of linguistic forms, which showed parallels to differences between late versus early deaf adult signers as reported by earlier studies. Deaf children in the current study, however, were similar to each other in the type of classifier handshapes that they used in their classifier constructions. Our findings have implications for expanding current knowledge on to what extent variation in language input (i.e., from early vs. late deaf signers) is reflected in children's productions as well as the role of linguistic input on language development in general.

Eye blinks are perceived as communicative signals in human face-to-face interaction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TURN-TAKING; ADDRESSEES; RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; SPEAKING; ORIGINS; MINDS	In face-to-face communication, recurring intervals of mutual gaze allow listeners to provide speakers with visual feedback (e.g. nodding). Here, we investigate the potential feedback function of one of the subtlest of human movements eye blinking. While blinking tends to be subliminal, the significance of mutual gaze in human interaction raises the question whether the interruption of mutual gaze through blinking may also be communicative. To answer this question, we developed a novel, virtual reality-based experimental paradigm, which enabled us to selectively manipulate blinking in a virtual listener, creating small differences in blink duration resulting in 'short' (208 ms) and 'long' (607 ms) blinks. We found that speakers unconsciously took into account the subtle differences in listeners' blink duration, producing substantially shorter answers in response to long listener blinks. Our findings suggest that, in addition to physiological, perceptual and cognitive functions, listener blinks are also perceived as communicative signals, directly influencing speakers' communicative behavior in face-to-face communication. More generally, these findings may be interpreted as shedding new light on the evolutionary origins of mental-state signaling, which is a crucial ingredient for achieving mutual understanding in everyday social interaction.

Much research since then has focused on phonetic and other cues that signal such prominence. Early findings emphasized the role of intonational pitch movements; more recent research demonstrates the importance of other phonetic cues, categorical differences between pitch movement types, and nonphonetic factors like word frequency. However, the definition of prominence itself remains informal and depends on intuitions that are well motivated primarily in European languages. Recent findings point to important differences between languages. These might be accommodated in a more comprehensive theory of word and sentence stress that treats both as manifestations of a hierarchical prosodic structure of the sort assumed in metrical phonology, while at the same time allowing for significant differences of prosodic typology.

This linguistic encoding is influenced by conceptual accessibility, particularly whether individuals in the event are animate or agentive - animates are more likely than inanimates to appear as Subject of a sentence, and agents are more likely than patients to appear as Subject. We tested whether perceptual aspects of a scene can override these two conceptual biases when they are aligned: whether a visually prominent inanimate patient will be selected as Subject when pitted against a visually backgrounded animate agent. We manipulated visual prominence by contrasting scenes in which the face/torso/hand of the agent were visible vs. scenes in which only the hand was visible. Events with only a hand were more often associated with passive descriptions, in both production and comprehension tasks. These results highlight the power of visual prominence to guide how people conceptualise events.

We focused on spatial expressions in which sign languages, unlike spoken languages, have a modality-driven preference to mention grounds (big objects) prior to figures (smaller objects). We compared hearing bimodal bilinguals' spatial expressions and visual attention in Dutch and Dutch Sign Language (N = 18) to those of their hearing non-signing (N = 20) and deaf signing peers (N = 18). In speech, hearing bimodal bilinguals expressed more ground-first descriptions and fixated grounds more than hearing non-signers, showing influence from sign. In sign, they used as many ground-first descriptions as deaf signers and fixated grounds equally often, demonstrating no influence from speech. Cross-linguistic influence of word order preference and visual attention in hearing bimodal bilinguals appears to be one-directional modulated by modality-driven differences.

While full specification is still the norm in psycholinguistic research, underspecified representations may better account for perceptual asymmetries. In this paper, we report on a mismatch negativity (MMN) study with Dutch listeners who took part in a passive oddball paradigm to investigate when the brain notices the difference between expected and observed vowels. In particular, we tested neural discrimination (indicating perceptual discrimination) of the tense mid vowel pairs /o/-/o/ (place contrast), /e/-/o/ (labiality or rounding contrast), and /e/-/o/ (place and labiality contrast). Our results show (a) a perceptual asymmetry for place in the /o/-/o/ contrast, supporting underspecification of [CORONAL] and replicating earlier results for German, and (b) a perceptual asymmetry for labiality for the /e/-/o/ contrast, which was not reported in the German study. A labial deviant [o] (standard /e/) yielded a larger MMN than a deviant [e] (standard /o/). No asymmetry was found for the two-feature contrast. This study partly replicates a similar MMN study on German vowels, and partly presents new findings indicating cross-linguistic differences. Although the vowel inventory of Dutch and German is to a large extent comparable, their (morpho)phonological systems are different, which is reflected in processing.	[de Rue, Nadine P. W.

The roles of cognitive abilities and hearing acuity in older adults' recognition of words taken from fast and spectrally reduced speech	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			English	Article						aging and language; hearing impairment; individual differences; memory and language; speech perception	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; PROCESSING-SPEED; LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; ELDERLY LISTENERS; PERCEPTION; MODEL; NOISE; AGE	Previous literature has identified several cognitive abilities as predictors of individual differences in speech perception. Working memory was chief among them, but effects have also been found for processing speed. Most research has been conducted on speech in noise, but fast and unclear articulation also makes listening challenging, particularly for older listeners. As a first step toward specifying the cognitive mechanisms underlying spoken word recognition, we set up this study to determine which factors explain unique variation in word identification accuracy in fast speech, and the extent to which this was affected by further degradation of the speech signal. To that end, 105 older adults were tested on identification accuracy of fast words in unaltered and degraded conditions in which the speech stimuli were low-pass filtered. They were also tested on processing speed, memory, vocabulary knowledge, and hearing sensitivity. A structural equation analysis showed that only memory and hearing sensitivity explained unique variance in word recognition in both listening conditions. Working memory was more strongly associated with performance in the unfiltered than in the filtered condition. These results suggest that memory skills, rather than speed, facilitate the mapping of single words onto stored lexical representations, particularly in conditions of medium difficulty.

J	Trujillo, JP; Simanova, I; Bekkering, H; Özyürek, A				Trujillo, James P.; Simanova, Irina; Bekkering, Harold; Ozyurek, Asli			The communicative advantage: how kinematic signaling supports semantic comprehension	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							GESTURE; MOVEMENTS; OTHERS; DESIGN	Humans are unique in their ability to communicate information through representational gestures which visually simulate an action (eg. moving hands as if opening a jar). Previous research indicates that the intention to communicate modulates the kinematics (e.g., velocity, size) of such gestures. If and how this modulation influences addressees' comprehension of gestures have not been investigated. Here we ask whether communicative kinematic modulation enhances semantic comprehension (i.e., identification) of gestures. We additionally investigate whether any comprehension advantage is due to enhanced early identification or late identification. Participants (n = 20) watched videos of representational gestures produced in a more- (n = 60) or less-communicative (n = 60) context and performed a forced-choice recognition task. We tested the isolated role of kinematics by removing visibility of actor's faces in Experiment I, and by reducing the stimuli to stick-light figures in Experiment II. Three video lengths were used to disentangle early identification from late identification. Accuracy and response time quantified main effects. Kinematic modulation was tested for correlations with task performance. We found higher gesture identification performance in more- compared to less-communicative gestures. However, early identification was only enhanced within a full visual context, while late identification occurred even when viewing isolated kinematics. Additionally, temporally segmented acts with more post-stroke holds were associated with higher accuracy. Our results demonstrate that communicative signaling, interacting with other visual cues, generally supports gesture identification, while kinematic modulation specifically enhances late identification in the absence of other cues. Results provide insights into mutual understanding processes as well as creating artificial communicative agents.

Therefore, it is essential that health information meets the needs and expectations of health consumers. Online health information is examined from the perspectives of patients with uterine cervical dysplasia undergoing a frequently performed gynecological procedure at an outpatient clinic of a general, top clinical Dutch hospital. The information behavior of 40 women was studied qualitatively by means of interviews and observations in three phases from the start of their medical episode: the emergence or lack of information needs (interviews); the choice for particular information sources or channels (interviews); and searching for information on the Internet (both observations and interviews). The results of the study identified five patterns of information behavior: inactive/passive (N = 5), sensitive/limited (N = 7), selective/problem solving (N = 5), constructive/explorative (N = 8), and assertive/browsing (N = 4). Examples of corresponding recommendations are discussed which aim at optimizing health information.

Consequently, the role of the medical oncologist is not only to provide best quality anti-cancer treatment, but also to address the impact of disease and treatment on a patient's life, the lived illness experience. We aimed to gain insights into whether and how medical oncologists working at an outpatient clinic identify and explore lived illness experiences raised by patients with advanced cancer, and how this influences patients' responses. Methods Conversation Analysis was applied to analyse 16 verbatim transcribed audio-recorded consultations. Results We identified 37 fragments in which patients expressed a lived experience from 11 of the 16 consultations. We found differing responses from different oncologists. Patients continued talking about their lived experiences if the listener produced a continuer such as humming or tried to capture the experience in their own words. In contrast, a response with optimistic talking or the presentation of medical evidence prevented patients from further unfolding the experience. In consultations in which the lived illness experience was most extensively unfolded, medical oncologists and patients could constantly see each other's facial expressions. Conclusions When a patient with advanced cancer spontaneously introduces a lived illness experience, it helps to identify and explore it when the medical oncologist produces a continuer or tries to capture this experience in their own words. Our findings can be implemented in training sessions, followed by frequent reinforcement in daily care.

Word skipping as an indicator of individual reading style during literary reading	JOURNAL OF EYE MOVEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Eye movements; gaze durations; word skipping; narratives; literary reading; individual differences	EYE-MOVEMENTS; FREQUENCY; EXPOSURE; PRINT; PREDICTABILITY; READERS	Decades of research have established that the content of language (e.g. lexical characteristics of words) predicts eye movements during reading. Here we investigate whether there exist individual differences in 'stable' eye movement patterns during narrative reading. We computed Euclidean distances from correlations between gaze durations time courses (word level) across 102 participants who each read three literary narratives in Dutch. The resulting distance matrices were compared between narratives using a Mantel test. The results show that correlations between the scaling matrices of different narratives are relatively weak (r =.11) when missing data points are ignored. However, when including these data points as zero durations (i.e. skipped words), we found significant correlations between stories (r >.51). Word skipping was significantly positively associated with print exposure but not with self-rated attention and story-world absorption, suggesting that more experienced readers are more likely to skip words, and do so in a comparable fashion. We interpret this finding as suggesting that word skipping might be a stable individual eye movement pattern.

Mental simulation during literary reading: Individual differences revealed with eye-tracking	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Motor simulation; perceptual simulation; mentalising; literary reading; eye-tracking; individual differences; absorption; appreciation	E-Z READER; MOVEMENT CONTROL; WORD-FREQUENCY; LANGUAGE; MOTOR; FICTION; COMPREHENSION; CONTEXT; TRANSPORTATION; ACTIVATION	People engage in simulation when reading literary narratives. In this study, we tried to pinpoint how different kinds of simulation (perceptual and motor simulation, mentalising) affect reading behaviour. Eye-tracking (gaze durations, regression probability) and questionnaire data were collected from 102 participants, who read three literary short stories. In a pre-test, 90 additional participants indicated which parts of the stories were high in one of the three kinds of simulation-eliciting content. The results show that motor simulation reduces gaze duration (faster reading), whereas perceptual simulation and mentalising increase gaze duration (slower reading). Individual differences in the effect of simulation on gaze duration were found, which were related to individual differences in aspects of story world absorption and story appreciation. These findings suggest fundamental differences between different kinds of simulation and confirm the role of simulation in absorption and appreciation.

Here we measured native Dutch speakers' convergence to a non-native speaker with an unfamiliar accent in a novel non-interactive task. Furthermore, we assessed the role of participants' perceptions of the non-native accent in their tendency to converge. In addition to a perceptual measure (AXB ratings), we examined convergence on different acoustic dimensions (e.g., vowel spectra, fricative CoG, speech rate, overall f0) to deter-mine what dimensions, if any, speakers converge to. We further combined these two types of measures to dis-cover what dimensions weighed in raters' judgments of convergence. The results reveal overall convergence to our non-native speaker, as indexed by both perceptual and acoustic measures. However, the ratings suggest the stronger participants rated the non-native accent to be, the less likely they were to converge. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that natives can phonetically converge to non-native speech, even without any apparent socio-communicative motivation to do so. We argue that our results are hard to integrate with a purely social view of convergence. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Influence of Mental Imagery Instructions and Personality Characteristics on Reading Experiences	COLLABRA-PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						literary reading; mental imagery; fantasy; personality; pre-reading instructions	PERCEIVED REALISM; TRANSPORTATION; FICTION; ENJOYMENT; SIMULATION; EXPOSURE; TESTS; PRINT; KNOWLEDGE; GENRE	It is well established that readers form mental images when reading a narrative. However, the consequences of mental imagery (i.e. the influence of mental imagery on the way people experience stories) are still unclear. Here we manipulated the amount of mental imagery that participants engaged in while reading short literary stories in two experiments. Participants received pre-reading instructions aimed at encouraging or discouraging mental imagery. After reading, participants answered questions about their reading experiences. We also measured individual trait differences that are relevant for literary reading experiences. The results from the first experiment suggests an important role of mental imagery in determining reading experiences. However, the results from the second experiment show that mental imagery is only a weak predictor of reading experiences compared to individual (trait) differences in how imaginative participants were. Moreover, the influence of mental imagery instructions did not extend to reading experiences unrelated to mental imagery. The implications of these results for the relationship between mental imagery and reading experiences are discussed.

Here, we investigate whether these adaptations are modulated by the speaker's age and cognitive abilities. Younger and older participants narrated six short comic stories to a same-aged addressee. Half of each story was known to both participants, the other half only to the speaker. The two age groups did not differ in terms of the number of words and narrative events mentioned per narration, or in terms of gesture frequency, gesture rate, or percentage of events expressed multimodally. However, only the younger participants reduced the amount of verbal and gestural information when narrating mutually known as opposed to novel story content. Age-related differences in cognitive abilities did not predict these differences in common ground-based recipient design. The older participants' communicative behaviour may therefore also reflect differences in social or pragmatic goals.

Multimodal Language Processing in Human Communication	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							REACTION-TIME-TASK; TURN-TAKING; ICONIC GESTURES; HAND GESTURES; SPEECH; COMPREHENSION; INTEGRATION; BODY; REPRESENTATION; ORGANIZATION	The natural ecology of human language is face-to-face interaction comprising the exchange of a plethora of multimodal signals. Trying to understand the psycholinguistic processing of language in its natural niche raises new issues, first and foremost the binding of multiple, temporally offset signals under tight time constraints posed by a turn-taking system. This might be expected to overload and slow our cognitive system, but the reverse is in fact the case. We propose cognitive mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon and call for a multimodal, situated psycholinguistic framework to unravel the full complexities of human language processing.

J	McLean, B; Dunn, M; Dingemanse, M				McLean, Bonnie; Dunn, Michael; Dingemanse, Mark			Two measures are better than one: combining iconicity ratings and guessing experiments for a more nuanced picture of iconicity in the lexicon	LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article; Early Access						Iconicity; Ideophones; Lexical norms; Iconicity ratings; Guessability	SOUND; ASSOCIATION; SYMBOLISM	Iconicity in language is receiving increased attention from many fields, but our understanding of iconicity is only as good as the measures we use to quantify it. We collected iconicity measures for 304 Japanese words from English-speaking participants, using rating and guessing tasks. The words included ideophones (structurally marked depictive words) along with regular lexical items from similar semantic domains (e.g., fuwafuwa 'fluffy', jawarakai 'soft'). The two measures correlated, speaking to their validity. However, ideophones received consistently higher iconicity ratings than other items, even when guessed at the same accuracies, suggesting the rating task is more sensitive to cues like structural markedness that frame words as iconic. These cues did not always guide participants to the meanings of ideophones in the guessing task, but they did make them more confident in their guesses, even when they were wrong. Consistently poor guessing results reflect the role different experiences play in shaping construals of iconicity. Using multiple measures in tandem allows us to explore the interplay between iconicity and these external factors. To facilitate this, we introduce a reproducible workflow for creating rating and guessing tasks from standardised wordlists, while also making improvements to the robustness, sensitivity and discriminability of previous approaches.

The term evidentiality refers to particular linguistic resources for talking about knowledge and especially to grammaticalized markers that indicate knowledge sources. Evidential marking is found in diverse languages around the world. This review discusses cross-linguistic evidential meanings and examines research on evidentials in practice, with a focus on their interpretation as stance markers and deictic elements. Evidentiality is a fascinating accomplishment in language structure, meaning, and use and can tell us about shared and disparate visions of knowledge and sociality across cultures.

Speakers mostly use richer forms as noun phrases (NPs) in speech and gesture more when referents have low accessibility, whereas they use reduced forms such as pronouns more often and gesture less when referents have high accessibility. We investigated the relationships between speech and gesture during reference tracking in a pro-drop language-Turkish. Overt pronouns were not strongly associated with accessibility but with pragmatic context (i.e., marking similarity, contrast). Nevertheless, speakers gestured more when referents were re-introduced versus maintained and when referents were expressed with NPs versus pronouns. Pragmatic context did not influence gestures. Further, pronouns in low-accessibility contexts were accompanied with gestures-possibly for reference disambiguation-more often than previously found for non-pro-drop languages in such contexts. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationships between speech and gesture at the discourse level.

Using memory-based learning to investigate the syntactic relationship between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						syntactic variation; Dutch; existential constructions; memory-based learning; national variation	LANGUAGE; DEFINITENESS	This article builds on computational tools to investigate the syntactic relationship between the highly related European national varieties of Dutch, viz. Belgian Dutch (BD) and Netherlandic Dutch (ND). It reports on a series of memory-based learning analyses of the post-verbal distribution of er "there" in adjunct-initial existential constructions like Op het dak staat (er) een schoorsteen "On the roof (there) is a chimney,', which has been claimed to be among the most notoriously difficult variables in Dutch. On the basis of balanced datasets extracted from Flemish and Dutch newspaper corpora, it is shown that er's distribution in both national varieties can be learned to a considerable extent from bare lexical input which is not assigned to higher-level categories. However, whereas this yields good results for ND, BD scores are consistently lower, suggesting that BD cannot do with lexical features alone to attain accuracy scores comparable to ND. This ties in with earlier findings that the more advanced standardization of ND materializes in a higher lexical collocability, whereas Flemish speakers need additional higher-level linguistic information to insert er.

Listening with great expectations: An investigation of word form anticipations in naturalistic speech	INTERSPEECH 2019	Interspeech		English	Proceedings Paper	Interspeech Conference	SEP 15-19, 2019	Graz, AUSTRIA			phonological mismatch negativity; speech perception; statistical language models; predictive coding; electroencephalography	PREDICTION; MODEL; SHORTLIST	The event-related potential (ERP) component named phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) arises when listeners hear an unexpected word form in a spoken sentence [1]. The PMN is thought to reflect the mismatch between expected and perceived auditory speech input. In this paper, we use the PMN to test a central premise in the predictive coding framework [2], namely that the mismatch between prior expectations and sensory input is an important mechanism of perception. We test this with natural speech materials containing approximately 50,000 word tokens. The corresponding EEG-signal was recorded while participants (n = 48) listened to these materials. Following [3], we quantify the mismatch with two word probability distributions (WPD): a WPD based on preceding context, and a WPD that is additionally updated based on the incoming audio of the current word. We use the between-WPD cross entropy for each word in the utterances and show that a higher cross entropy correlates with a more negative PMN. Our results show that listeners anticipate auditory input while processing each word in naturalistic speech. Moreover, complementing previous research, we show that predictive language processing occurs across the whole probability spectrum.

APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						Glioma; processing speed; word-finding problems; cognition	ELOQUENT AREAS; AWAKE SURGERY; FUNCTIONAL COMMUNICATION; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; NORMATIVE DATA; RESECTION; TRAIL; TUMOR; DEFICITS	Background: Glioma (brain tumour) patients can suffer from mild linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive problems when the glioma is localised in an eloquent brain area. Word-finding problems are among the most frequently reported complaints. However, mild problems are difficult to measure with standard language tests because they are generally designed for more severe aphasic patients. Aims: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether word-finding problems reported by patients with a glioma can be objectified with a standard object naming test, and a linguistic processing speed test. In addition, we examined whether word-finding problems and linguistic processing speed are related to non-verbal cognitive abilities. Methods & Procedures: We tested glioma patients (N=36) as part of their standard pre-treatment clinical work-up. Word-finding problems were identified by a clinical linguist during the anamnesis. Linguistic processing speed was assessed with a newly designed sentence judgment test (SJT) as part of the Diagnostic Instrument for Mild Aphasia (DIMA), lexical retrieval with the Boston Naming Test (BNT), presence of aphasia with a Token Test (TT), and nonverbal processing with the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT). Test performances of glioma patients were compared to those of healthy control participants (N=35). Outcomes & Results: The results show that many glioma patients (58%) report word-finding problems; these complaints were in only half of the cases supported by deviant scores on the BNT. Moreover, the presence of reported word-finding problems did not correlate with the BNT scores. However, word-finding problems were significantly correlated with reaction times on the SJT and the TMT. Although there were no significant differences between the patient and control group on the SJT, a subgroup of patients with a glioma in the frontal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere was slower on the SJT. Finally, performance on the SJT and TMT were significantly correlated in the patient group but not in the control group. Conclusions: Linguistic processing speed appears to be an important factor in explaining reported word-finding problems. Moreover, the overlap between speed of language processing and non-verbal processing indicates that patients may rely on more domain-general cognitive abilities as compared to healthy participants. The variability observed between patients emphasises the need for tailored neuro-linguistic assessments including an extensive anamnesis regarding language problems in clinical workup.

Objective: The current study examined how to inform patients fully about treatment side effects without increasing their occurrence. Extending theoretical assumptions about self-affirmation from the social-psychological to the medical domain, we tested whether allowing cancer patients to self-affirm prior to informing them about potential cognitive decline reduced the occurrence of Adverse Information Effects (ME) on cognitive problem reporting (CPR) and verbal memory performance. Method: Participants were 90 Dutch and Belgian gastrointestinal cancer patients with and without chemotherapy experience. Patients were randomized across three experimental conditions (information about chemotherapy-related cognitive problems with or without self-affirmation; no-information control) before completing an online questionnaire. Data were collected from May until August 2015. Main dependent variables were CPR and verbal memory performance. Stigma consciousness was included as a moderator. Results: Informing patients about chemotherapy-related cognitive problems increased CPR and decreased scores on two out of three memory measures. Self-affirmation reduced these ME. Stigma conscious patients reported more problems in the information than the self-affirmation group. Conclusions: Nocebo effects may be reduced by allowing patients the opportunity to restore their self-integrity at the implicit level. Self-affirmation has the potential to reduce ME in patient populations without withholding relevant information about potential treatment side effects.

The PPVT-4 was administered to Dutch pupils in six different age groups (4-15 years old) who were or were not following an English educational programme at school. Our first finding was that the PPVT-4 was not a reliable measure for pupils who were correct on maximally 24 items, but it was reliable for pupils who performed better. Second, both primary-school and secondary-school pupils performed better on items for which the phonological similarity between the English word and its Dutch translation was higher. Third, young unexperienced L2 learners' scores were predicted by Dutch lexical frequency, while older more experienced pupils' scores were predicted by English frequency. These findings indicate that the PPVT may be inappropriate for use with L2 learners with limited L2 proficiency. Furthermore, comparisons of PPVT scores across learners with different L1s are confounded by effects of L1 frequency and L1-L2 similarity. The PPVT-4 is however a suitable measure to compare more proficient L2 learners who have the same L1.

Thus, breaking mirror invariance offers an important tool for understanding cultural re-shaping of evolutionarily ancient cognitive mechanisms. Here we investigated the role of script (i.e., presence vs. absence of mirrored graphs: Latin alphabet vs. Tamil) by revisiting mirror-image processing by illiterate, Tamil monoliterate, and Tamil-Latin-alphabet bi-literate adults. Participants performed two same-different tasks (one orientation-based, another shape-based) on Latin-alphabet letters. Tamil monoliterate were significantly better than illiterate and showed good explicit mirror-image discrimination. However, only bi-literate adults fully broke mirror invariance: slower shape-based judgments for mirrored than identical pairs and reduced disadvantage in orientation-based over shape-based judgments of mirrored pairs. These findings suggest learning a script with mirrored graphs is the strongest force for breaking mirror invariance.

The present study tests the boundaries of the effect of language on odor cognition by examining the effect of grammatical gender. We presented participants with male and female fragrances paired with descriptions of masculine or feminine grammatical gender. In Experiment 1 we found that memory for fragrances was enhanced when the grammatical gender of a fragrance description matched the gender of the fragrance. In Experiment 2 we found memory for fragrances was affected by both grammatical gender and gender associations in fragrance descriptions - recognition memory for odors was higher when the gender was incongruent. In sum, we demonstrated that even subtle aspects of language can affect odor cognition.

Quantifying expectation modulation in human speech processing	INTERSPEECH 2019	Interspeech		English	Proceedings Paper	Interspeech Conference	SEP 15-19, 2019	Graz, AUSTRIA			speech perception; predictive coding; statistical language modelling; automatic speech recognition	PREDICTION; MODEL; SHORTLIST; WORD	The mismatch between top-down predicted and bottom-up perceptual input is an important mechanism of perception according to the predictive coding framework (Friston, [1]). In this paper we develop and validate a new information-theoretic measure that quantifies the mismatch between expected and observed auditory input during speech processing. We argue that such a mismatch measure is useful for the study of speech processing. To compute the mismatch measure, we use naturalistic speech materials containing approximately 50,000 word tokens. For each word token we first estimate the prior word probability distribution with the aid of statistical language modelling, and next use automatic speech recognition to update this word probability distribution based on the unfolding speech signal. We validate the mismatch measure with multiple analyses, and show that the auditory-based update improves the probability of the correct word and lowers the uncertainty of the word probability distribution. Based on these results, we argue that it is possible to explicitly estimate the mismatch between predicted and perceived speech input with the cross entropy between word expectations computed before and after an auditory update.

Does production of language-specific co-speech gestures further guide speakers' visual attention during message preparation? Here, we examine the link between visual attention and multimodal event descriptions in Turkish. Turkish is a verb-framed language where speakers' speech and gesture show language specificity with path of motion mostly expressed within the main verb accompanied by path gestures. Turkish-speaking adults viewed motion events while their eye movements were recorded during non-linguistic (viewing-only) and linguistic (viewing-before-describing) tasks. The relative attention allocated to path over manner was higher in the linguistic task compared to the non-linguistic task. Furthermore, the relative attention allocated to path over manner within the linguistic task was higher when speakers (a) encoded path in the main verb versus outside the verb and (b) used additional path gestures accompanying speech versus not. Results strongly suggest that speakers' visual attention is guided by language-specific event encoding not only in speech but also in gesture. This provides evidence consistent with models that propose integration of speech and gesture at the conceptualization level of language production and suggests that the links between the eye and the mouth may be extended to the eye and the hand.

Previously, it was shown that adults with dyslexia respond differently to online manipulations of auditory feedback. In the present study, we found that individual differences in reading and reading-related skills within a group of 30 children (10-13 years old) with dyslexia were associated with the response to altered feedback. The fractional anisotropy of the arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus was not directly related to the response to altered feedback. This study corroborates that speech perception-production communication is important for phonological representations and reading.	[van den Bunt, M. R.; Groen, M. A.; van der Kleij, S.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CORPUS LINGUISTICS			English	Article						speech registers; word predictability; text classification; statistical language modelling; register analysis		Previous research has demonstrated that language use can vary depending on the context of situation. The present paper extends this finding by comparing word predictability differences between 14 speech registers ranging from highly informal conversations to read-aloud books. We trained 14 statistical language models to compute register-specific word predictability and trained a register classifier on the perplexity score vector of the language models. The classifier distinguishes perfectly between samples from all speech registers and this result generalizes to unseen materials. We show that differences in vocabulary and sentence length cannot explain the speech register classifier's performance. The combined results show that speech registers differ in word predictability.

A cognitive account of subjectivity put to the test: using an insertion task to investigate Mandarin result connectives	COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article						causality; connectives; crowdsourcing; modality words; subjectivity	CAUSAL CONNECTIVES; CORPUS; TERMS	This article aims to further test the cognitive claims of the so-called subjectivity account of causal events and their linguistic markers, causal connectives. We took Mandarin Chinese, a language that is typologically completely different from the usual western languages, as a case to provide evidence for this subjectivity account. Complementary to the commonly used corpora analyses, we employed crowdsourcing to tap native speakers' intuitions about causal coherence, focusing on four result connectives kejian 'therefore', suoyi 'so', yinci 'so/for this reason' and yushi 'thereupon/as a result'. The analysis shows systematic differences regarding the use of connectives in relations that differ in terms of subjectivity, demonstrating that native speakers make use of subjectivity to encode and decode different types of causal relations in discourse. Moreover, our study evidences that a comprehensive model of subjectivity should include the epistemic dimension of certainty about the subjectivity scale that might be indicated by other linguistic elements. In-depth analyses of the test items revealed that the presence/absence of modality words in the result segments are related to different preferential patterns for the connectives. There is a trade-off between the epistemic dimension of certainty and the expression of subjectivity in the four connectives involved.

This study quantified language use differences of general practitioners (GPs), and assessed their relation to patient anxiety. Methods: Language use of 18 Dutch GPs during 82 consultations was compared for patients with MUS versus medically explained symptoms (MES). Message content (positive or negative) was differentiated from its directness (direct or indirect), and related to changes in patient's state anxiety (abbreviated State Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI). Results: In total, 2590 clauses were identified. GPs approached patients with MES with relatively more direct (vs. indirect) positive and indirect (vs. direct) negative messages (OR 1.91, 95% Cl 1.42-2.59). Anxiety of both patient groups increased when GPs used more direct (vs. indirect) negative messages (b = 0.67, 95% CI 0.07-1.27) Conclusions: GPs use different language depending on the content of messages for patients with MES, but not MUS. Direct negative messages relate to an increase in patient anxiety. Practice implications: GPs could manage patient's state anxiety by expressing negative messages in an indirect rather than direct manner. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been suggested that shared sign languages exhibit more variation in the expression of everyday concepts than deaf community sign languages (Meir, Israel, Sandler, Padden, & Aronoff, 2012). For deaf community sign languages, it has been shown that various sociolinguistic factors condition this variation. This study presents one of the first in-depth investigations of how sociolinguistic factors (deaf status, age, clan, gender and having a deaf family member) affect lexical variation in a shared sign language, using a picture description task in Kata Kolok. To study lexical variation in Kata Kolok, two methodologies are devised: the identification of signs by underlying iconic motivation and mapping, and a way to compare individual repertoires of signs by calculating the lexical distances between participants. Alongside presenting novel methodologies to study this type of sign language, we present preliminary evidence of sociolinguistic factors that may influence variation in the Kata Kolok lexicon.

But does iconicity in spoken language have a special status when it comes to learnability? A simple way to gauge learnability is to see how well something is retrieved from memory. We can further contrast this with guessability, to see (1) whether the ease of guessing the meanings of ideophones outperforms the rate at which they are remembered; and (2) how willing participants' are to reassess what they were taught in a prior task-a novel contribution of this study. We replicate prior guessing and memory tasks using ideophones and adjectives from Japanese, Korean, and Igbo. Our results show that although native Cantonese speakers guessed ideophone meanings above chance level, they memorized both ideophones and adjectives with comparable accuracy. However, response time data show that participants took significantly longer to respond correctly to adjective-meaning pairs-indicating a discrepancy in a cognitive effort that favored the recognition of ideophones. In a follow-up reassessment task, participants who were taught foil translations were more likely to choose the true translations for ideophones rather than adjectives. By comparing the findings from our guessing and memory tasks, we conclude that iconicity is more accessible if a task requires participants to actively seek out sound-meaning associations.

To meet this demand, innovative delivery of speech training is required. eHealth applications may provide a solution, as intensified and prolonged training is only possible and affordable in patients' home environment. Aims This study explores the effects on speech intelligibility of game-based speech training that provides automatic feedback on loudness, pitch and pronunciation. Additionally, we investigate how satisfied patients are with the game-based speech training and how they experience the automatic feedback. Furthermore, patients' preferences for game-based speech training compared with face-to-face training are explored. Methods and Procedures Eight adult dysarthric speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) completed a 4-week game-based speech training in their home environment. For each speaker, 24 speech utterances were audio recorded 4 weeks before (T1), immediately before (T2) and immediately after (T3) the training. All speech samples were rated on speech intelligibility by 10 untrained listeners, by comparing them with the corresponding utterances realized by a healthy speaker. Changes over time were analysed using a linear mixed-effects analysis. Patient satisfaction with the game and the automatic feedback was assessed using a questionnaire. The preferences of patients were collected using a paired comparisons procedure in which the patients were asked whether they would prefer game-based or face-to-face speech training in four hypothetical scenarios with different hypothesized levels of speech improvement. Outcomes and Results While there was no significant difference in speech intelligibility ratings between T1 and T2, we did find one between T2 and T3. At T3, speech intelligibility was rated higher than at T2, indicating positive effects of the game-based speech training. Patients generally seemed satisfied with the game as average ratings were above 7 on a 10-point rating scale. Generally, patients agreed with the automatic feedback and could use it to positively change the way they spoke. Patients prefer the training that provides the highest hypothetical improvement, and thus do not prefer face-to-face above game-based therapy. Conclusions and Implications The results of this study suggest that dysarthric speakers due to PD see game-based speech therapy as a valid alternative for face-to-face therapy and that it leads to an average improvement in speech intelligibility. For an optimal effect and user satisfaction it should preferably not be used in isolation but in combination with face-to-face training. In this manner, the strengths of both therapeutic deliveries can be harnessed. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What is already known on this subject Dysarthric speech in patients with PD is known to benefit from intensified and long-term speech therapy. The increasing need for speech therapy due to our ageing population raises the demand on therapeutical resources making highly frequent and long-term therapy difficult. eHealth provides the opportunity to intensify and prolong speech training in patients' home environment. A drill-and-practice method was employed and investigated in a web-based speech application, indicating positive effects on speech intelligibility. However, participants indicated a lack of variation in exercises making the training less enjoyable. Other research showed that serious games can increase enjoyment during training. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The results of this study show that it is possible to develop a serious game that can be successfully used for speech training by patients with dysarthria due to PD. Comparing speech intelligibility ratings before and after training, we observed significant improvements in speech intelligibility ratings. Patients generally agree with the automatic feedback and can use it to positively change the way they speak. Average ratings were above 7 on a 10-point scale, indicating that patients are satisfied with the game. Patients prefer the type of training (game based or face to face) that provides the highest hypothetical improvement. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The results of this study suggest that game-based speech training can improve speech intelligibility in patients. This indicates that it can be considered a suitable approach in the treatment of patients with dysarthria due to PD. Patients do not prefer game-based training above face-to-face training in all scenarios. For that reason, for every patient one should carefully consider how to optimally combine game-based and face-to-face training.

One essential but understudied issue is whether languages differ in which body parts they single out for naming. This paper takes a multi-method approach to investigate body part nomenclature within a single language family. Using both a naming task (Study 1) and colouring-in task (Study 2) to collect data from six Japonic languages, we found that lexical similarity for body part terminology was notably differentiated within Japonic, and similar variation was evident in semantics too. Novel application of cluster analysis on naming data revealed a relatively flat hierarchical structure for parts of the face, whereas parts of the body were organised with deeper hierarchical structure. The colouring data revealed that bounded parts show more stability across languages than unbounded parts. Overall, the data reveal there is not a single universal conceptualisation of the body as is often assumed, and that in-depth, multi-method explorations of understudied languages are urgently required.

M.; van den Broek, Brenda; De Maeyer, Sven			Syntactic predictors for text quality in Dutch upper-secondary school students' L1 argumentative writing	READING AND WRITING			English	Article						Argumentative writing; Syntactic complexity; Text quality; Secondary education; Dutch language	LINGUISTIC FEATURES; COMPLEXITY	Among other things, learning to write entails learning how to use complex sentences effectively in discourse. Some research has therefore focused on relating measures of syntactic complexity to text quality. Apart from the fact that the existing research on this topic appears inconclusive, most of it has been conducted in English L1 contexts. This is potentially problematic, since relevant syntactic indices may not be the same across languages. The current study is the first to explore which syntactic features predict text quality in Dutch secondary school students' argumentative writing. In order to do so, the quality of 125 argumentative essays written by students was rated and the syntactic features of the texts were analyzed. A multilevel regression analysis was then used to investigate which features contribute to text quality. The resulting model (explaining 14.5% of the variance in text quality) shows that the relative number of finite clauses and the ratio between the number of relative clauses and the number of finite clauses positively predict text quality. Discrepancies between our findings and those of previous studies indicate that the relations between syntactic features and text quality may vary based on factors such as language and genre. Additional (cross-linguistic) research is needed to gain a more complete understanding of the relationships between syntactic constructions and text quality and the potential moderating role of language and genre.

We approach this question by studying it at the level of the dyad, and in terms of multimodal utterances. We investigate whether and how people minimize their joint speech and gesture efforts in face-to-face interactions, using linguistic and kinematic analyses. We zoom in on other-initiated repair-a conversational microcosm where people coordinate their utterances to solve problems with perceiving or understanding. We find that efforts in the spoken and gestural modalities are wielded in parallel across repair turns of different types, and that people repair conversational problems in the most cost-efficient way possible, minimizing the joint multimodal effort for the dyad as a whole. These results are in line with the principle of least collaborative effort in speech and with the reduction of joint costs in non-linguistic joint actions. The results extend our understanding of those coefficiency principles by revealing that they pertain to multimodal utterance design.

Past research had found that, in a monologue to a listener, speakers shortened repeated words. However, the notion of the given-new contract is inherently dialogic, with an addressee and the availability of co-speech gestures. Here, two face-to-face dialogue experiments tested whether gesture duration also follows the given-new contract. In Experiment 1, four experimental sequences confirmed that when speakers repeated their gestures, they shortened the duration significantly. Experiment 2 replicated the effect with spontaneous gestures in a different task. This experiment also extended earlier results with words, confirming that speakers shortened their repeated words significantly in a multimodal dialogue setting, the basic form of language use. Because words and gestures were not necessarily redundant, these results offer another instance in which gestures and words independently serve pragmatic requirements of dialogue.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Frequency effects; Prediction; Postdiction; Retrodiction; Stored sequences	LANGUAGE; RECOGNITION; TIME	An important debate on the architecture of the language faculty has been the extent to which it relies on a compositional system that constructs larger units from morphemes to words to phrases to utterances on the fly and in real time using grammatical rules; or a system that chunks large preassembled, stored units of language from memory; or some combination of both approaches. Good empirical evidence exists for both 'computed' and 'large stored' forms in language, but little is known about what shapes multi-word storage/ access or compositional processing. Here we explored whether predictive and retrodictive processes are a likely determinant of multi-word storage/ processing. Our results suggest that forward and backward predictability are independently informative in determining the lexical cohesiveness of multi-word phrases. In addition, our results call for a reevaluation of the role of retrodiction in contemporary language processing accounts (cf. Ferreira and Chantavarin, 2018).

In this study, we therefore aimed to test under what conditions the mentalizing network contributes to communicative language production. We were especially interested in distinguishing between situations in which speakers have to consider which information they do or do not share with their addressee (common vs. privileged ground information). We therefore manipulated whether speakers had to distinguish between common and privileged ground in order to communicate efficiently with the listener, in addition to comparing language production in a communicative and a non-communicative context. Participants performed a referential communicative game in the MRI-scanner as well as a similar, non-communicative task. We found that the medial prefrontal cortex, a core region of the mentalizing network, is especially sensitive to communicative contexts in which speakers have to take their addressee's needs into account in order to communicate efficiently. In addition, we found neural differences between the communicative and the non-communicative settings before speakers started to plan their utterances, suggesting that they continuously update common ground in a communicative context.

J	Slonimska, A; Ozyurek, A; Capirci, O				Slonimska, Anita; Ozyurek, Asli; Capirci, Olga			The role of iconicity and simultaneity for efficient communication: The case of Italian Sign Language (LIS)	COGNITION			English	Article						Efficient communication; Simultaneity; Iconicity; Sign language; Linearization problem	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VISUAL-SPATIAL LANGUAGE; WORKING-MEMORY; DEPENDENCY DISTANCE; CAPACITY; FEATURES; LENGTH; SPAN; REPRESENTATION; MINIMIZATION	A fundamental assumption about language is that, regardless of language modality, it faces the linearization problem, i.e., an event that occurs simultaneously in the world has to be split in language to be organized on a temporal scale. However, the visual modality of signed languages allows its users not only to express meaning in a linear manner but also to use iconicity and multiple articulators together to encode information simultaneously. Accordingly, in cases when it is necessary to encode informatively rich events, signers can take advantage of simultaneous encoding in order to represent information about different referents and their actions simultaneously. This in turn would lead to more iconic and direct representation. Up to now, there has been no experimental study focusing on simultaneous encoding of information in signed languages and its possible advantage for efficient communication. In the present study, we assessed how many information units can be encoded simultaneously in Italian Sign Language (LIS) and whether the amount of simultaneously encoded information varies based on the amount of information that is required to be expressed. Twenty-three deaf adults participated in a director-matcher game in which they described 30 images of events that varied in amount of information they contained. Results revealed that as the information that had to be encoded increased, signers also increased use of multiple articulators to encode different information (i.e., kinematic simultaneity) and density of simultaneously encoded information in their production. Present findings show how the fundamental properties of signed languages, i.e., iconicity and simultaneity, are used for the purpose of efficient information encoding in Italian Sign Language (LIS).

Our main goal was to find a set of attributes for the creation of automatic taggers with improved performance over the bag-of-words (bow) approach. The performance was measured using precision, recall and F-1. Because it is a relatively unexplored field, the study covers the creation of the corpus (composed by eleven verbs), the use of a parser to extract syntactic and semantic information from the sentences and a machine learning approach to identify modality values. Based on three different sets of attributes - from trigger itself and the trigger's path (from the parse tree) and context - the system creates a tagger for each verb achieving (in almost every verb) an improvement in F-1 when compared to the traditional bow approach.

Unsupervised Text Segmentation Predicts Eye Fixations During Reading	FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						text segmentation; eye movement; unsupervised learning; reading units; mental lexicon; computational cognition; cognitive unit	INTERACTIVE ACTIVATION MODEL; MOVEMENT CONTROL; COMPOUND WORDS; INFORMATION; LENGTH; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; TRACKING; GUIDANCE; READERS	Words typically form the basis of psycholinguistic and computational linguistic studies about sentence processing. However, recent evidence shows the basic units during reading, i.e., the items in the mental lexicon, are not always words, but could also be sub-word and supra-word units. To recognize these units, human readers require a cognitive mechanism to learn and detect them. In this paper, we assume eye fixations during reading reveal the locations of the cognitive units, and that the cognitive units are analogous with the text units discovered by unsupervised segmentation models. We predict eye fixations by model-segmented units on both English and Dutch text. The results show the model-segmented units predict eye fixations better than word units. This finding suggests that the predictive performance of model-segmented units indicates their plausibility as cognitive units. The Less-is-Better (LiB) model, which finds the units that minimize both long-term and working memory load, offers advantages both in terms of prediction score and efficiency among alternative models. Our results also suggest that modeling the least-effort principle for the management of long-term and working memory can lead to inferring cognitive units. Overall, the study supports the theory that the mental lexicon stores not only words but also smaller and larger units, suggests that fixation locations during reading depend on these units, and shows that unsupervised segmentation models can discover these units.

This kind of behavioral alignment has been studied across a wide range of disciplines and has been accounted for by diverging theories. In this paper, we review various operationalizations of lexical and gestural alignment. We reveal that scholars have fundamentally different takes on when and how behavior is considered to be aligned, which makes it difficult to compare findings and draw uniform conclusions. Furthermore, we show that scholars tend to focus on one particular dimension of alignment (traditionally, whether two instances of behavior overlap in form), while other dimensions remain understudied. This hampers theory testing and building, which requires a well-defined account of the factors that are central to or might enhance alignment. To capture the complex nature of alignment, we identify five key dimensions to formalize the relationship between any pair of behavior: time, sequence, meaning, form, and modality. We show how assumptions regarding the underlying mechanism of alignment (placed along the continuum of priming vs. grounding) pattern together with operationalizations in terms of the five dimensions. This integrative framework can help researchers in the field of alignment and related phenomena (including behavior matching, mimicry, entrainment, and accommodation) to formulate their hypotheses and operationalizations in a more transparent and systematic manner. The framework also enables us to discover unexplored research avenues and derive new hypotheses regarding alignment.

We address this debate by posing two critical questions: to what extent do humans represent events in terms of abstract role categories, and to what extent are these categories shaped by universal cognitive biases? We review a range of literature that contributes answers to these questions: psycholinguistic and event cognition experiments with adults, children, and infants; typological studies grounded in cross-linguistic data; and studies of emerging sign languages. We pose these questions for a variety of roles and find that the answers depend on the role. For Agents and Patients, there is strong evidence for abstract role categories and a universal bias to distinguish the two roles. For Goals and Recipients, we find clear evidence for abstraction but mixed evidence as to whether there is a bias to encode Goals and Recipients as part of one or two distinct categories. Finally, we discuss the Instrumental role and do not find clear evidence for either abstraction or universal biases to structure instrumental categories.

The relation of categorical linguistic content with continuous kinematics is therefore poorly understood. Here, we reanalyzed the video data from a gestural evolution experiment (Motamedi, Schouwstra, Smith, Culbertson, & Kirby, 2019), which showed increases in the systematicity of gesture content over time. We applied computer vision techniques to quantify the kinematics of the original data. Our kinematic analyses demonstrated that gestures become more efficient and less complex in their kinematics over generations of learners. We further detect the systematicity of gesture form on the level of thegesture kinematic interrelations, which directly scales with the systematicity obtained on semantic coding of the gestures. Thus, from continuous kinematics alone, we can tap into linguistic aspects that were previously only approachable through categorical coding of meaning. Finally, going beyond issues of systematicity, we show how unique gesture kinematic dialects emerged over generations as isolated chains of participants gradually diverged over iterations from other chains. We, thereby, conclude that gestures can come to embody the linguistic system at the level of interrelationships between communicative tokens, which should calibrate our theories about form and linguistic content.

Yet, little is known of how specific properties of music impact speech processing. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the effect of the 1) complexity of the background music, and 2) the presence versus absence of sung lyrics on spoken-word recognition in background music. To answer these questions, a word identification experiment was run in which Dutch participants listened to Dutch CVC words embedded in stretches of background music in four conditions: low/high complexity and with lyrics/music-only, and at three SNRs. Music stretches with and without lyrics were sampled from the same song in order to control for factors beyond the complexity of the music and the presence of lyrics. The results showed a clear negative impact of more complex music and the presence of lyrics in background music on spoken-word recognition. The results open a path for future work, and suggest that social spaces (e.g., restaurants, caf s and bars) should make careful choices of music to promote conversation.

In this study, we investigated how frequency-specific brain dynamics relate to models of probabilistic language prediction during auditory narrative comprehension. We recorded MEG activity while participants were listening to auditory stories in Dutch. Using trigram statistical language models, we estimated for every word in a story its conditional probability of occurrence. On the basis of word probabilities, we computed how unexpected the current word is given its context (word perplexity) and how (un)predictable the current linguistic context is (word entropy). We then evaluated whether source-reconstructed MEG oscillations at different frequency bands are modulated as a function of these language processing metrics. We show that theta-band source dynamics are increased in high relative to low entropy states, likely reflecting lexical computations. Beta-band dynamics are increased in situations of low word entropy and perplexity possibly reflecting maintenance of ongoing cognitive context. These findings lend support to the idea that the brain engages in the active generation and evaluation of predicted language based on the statistical properties of the input signal.

At the same time, speech reduction is known to cause problems for non-natives' speech comprehension. We investigate whether processing of full and reduced forms of cognates can help to better understand how reduced forms are represented in the mental lexicon. In an English auditory lexical decision task during which the brain response (EEG) was recorded, highly proficient Dutch learners of English listened to full and reduced forms of cognates and non-cognates. In the reduced forms, schwa was omitted. This schwa reduction occurred in either poststress or prestress position. While behavioural data (accuracy and reaction time) did not yield convincing information about the status of reduced forms, EEG data strongly suggest that form representations play an important role, in both prestress and poststress words. The results have clear implications for theories and models of spoken word recognition.

A.; Majid, Asifa; van Hout, Roeland			The geographical configuration of a language area influences linguistic diversity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE FLOW; PHENOTYPIC DIVERGENCE; POPULATION; EXPANSION; SUPPORTS; DISTANCE; PACKAGE; DRIFT	Like the transfer of genetic variation through gene flow, language changes constantly as a result of its use in human interaction. Contact between speakers is most likely to happen when they are close in space, time, and social setting. Here, we investigated the role of geographical configuration in this process by studying linguistic diversity in Japan, which comprises a large connected mainland (less isolation, more potential contact) and smaller island clusters of the Ryukyuan archipelago (more isolation, less potential contact). We quantified linguistic diversity using dialectometric methods, and performed regression analyses to assess the extent to which distance in space and time predict contemporary linguistic diversity. We found that language diversity in general increases as geographic distance increases and as time passes- as with biodiversity. Moreover, we found that (I) for mainland languages, linguistic diversity is most strongly related to geographic distance- a so- called isolation- by- distance pattern, and that (II) for island languages, linguistic diversity reflects the time since varieties separated and diverged- an isolation- by- colonisation pattern. Together, these results confirm previous findings that (linguistic) diversity is shaped by distance, but also goes beyond this by demonstrating the critical role of geographic configuration.

Here we revisit cutting and breaking in the Japonic language area by collecting new naming data for 40 videoclips depicting cutting and breaking events in Standard Japanese, the highly divergent Tohoku dialects, as well as four related Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Okinawa, Miyako and Yaeyama). We find that the Japonic languages recapitulate the same semantic dimensions attested in the previous typological study, confirming that semantic variation in the domain of cutting and breaking is indeed cross-linguistically constrained. We then compare our new Japonic data to previously collected Germanic data and find that, in general, related languages resemble each other more than unrelated languages, and that the Japonic languages resemble each other more than the Germanic languages do. Nevertheless, English resembles all of the Japonic languages more than it resembles Swedish. Together, these findings show that the rate and extent of semantic change can differ between language families, indicating the existence of lineage-specific developments on top of universal cross-linguistic constraints.

This study provides empirical evidence of a serial multiple mediator model supporting the relationship between English L2 students' morphological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, reading proficiency and academic achievement. Comparisons were made at two levels: general English and academic English. Data were acquired from 454 secondand third-year English L2 university students in Ghana, West Africa. Using two different mediation analyses, the study produced significant evidence for a two-mediator model at both levels. Morphological awareness is modelled as affecting academic achievement through four different pathways: indirectly through vocabulary, indirectly through reading comprehension, indirectly through vocabulary and reading comprehension sequentially, and directly. This shows that knowledge of morphology both directly and indirectly influences academic achievement at tertiary level in English L2 contexts. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A vocabulary deficit and poor pronunciation skills hinder learners in their efforts to improve speaking proficiency. In the present study, we investigated the effects of using two language learning websites, I Love Indonesia (ILI) and NovoLearning (NOVO). These websites are equipped with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, with each website providing different types of immediate feedback. We measured written receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge of 40 target words before and after the intervention in which 146 students practiced with these two ASR-based websites, and compared it to that of a control group (n = 86). The ASR-based websites successfully helped students enhance their receptive vocabulary. Twenty-four students participated in a spoken pre-and post-test pronouncing the same 40 target words. We successfully developed an approach to measure pronunciation skills which showed that the treatment groups outperformed the control group. Our results indicate that our technology is successful in improving vocabulary and pronunciation skills.

Previous research focused on general communication patterns in these interactions; however, an overview of more detailed interactional and linguistic aspects is lacking. This review aims to gain a detailed understanding of communicative challenges in MUS consultations by synthesizing evidence from conversation and discourse analytic research. Methods: A systematic review of publications using eight databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, MLA International Bibliography, LLBA and Communication Abstracts). Search terms included 'MUS', 'linguistics' and 'communication'. Additional studies were identified by contacting experts and searching bibliographies. We included linguistic and/or interactional analyses of natural patient-provider interactions about MUS. Two authors independently extracted the data, and quality appraisal was based on internal and external validity. Results: We identified 18 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The linguistic and interactional features of MUS consultations pertained to three dimensions: 1) symptom recognition, 2) double trouble potential (i.e. patients and providers may have differing views on symptoms and differing knowledge domains), and 3) negotiation and persuasion (in terms of acceptable explanations and subsequent psychological treatment). We describe the recurrent linguistic and interactional features of these interactions. Conclusions: Despite the presence of a double trouble potential in MUS consultations, validation of symptoms and subtle persuasive conduct may facilitate agreement on illness models and subsequent (psychological) treatment.

We investigated whether learning linguistic labels in a collaborative context at least partly relies on cognitively and neurally distinct representations, as compared to learning in an individual context. Healthy human participants learned labels for sets of abstract shapes in three different tasks. They came up with labels with another person in a collaborative communication task (collaborative condition), by themselves (individual condition), or were given pre-determined unrelated labels to learn by themselves (arbitrary condition). Immediately after learning, participants retrieved and produced the labels aloud during a communicative task in the MRI scanner. The fMRI results show that the retrieval of collaboratively generated labels as compared to individually learned labels engages brain regions involved in understanding others (mentalizing or theory of mind) and autobiographical memory, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the right temporoparietal junction and the precuneus. This study is the first to show that collaboration during encoding affects the neural networks involved in retrieval.

Across all listeners, better speaking-style categorization of careful read and casual conversation speech was associated with more accurate recognition of speech across those same two speaking styles. Findings suggest that some cochlear implant users and normal-hearing listeners under cochlear implant simulation may benefit from stronger encoding of indexical information in speech, enabling both better categorization and recognition of speech produced in different speaking styles.

This study aimed to examine when and how primary care physicians and patients interrupt each other during consultations.METHODS We coded and quantitatively analyzed interruption type (cooperative vs intru-sive) in 84 natural interactions between 17 primary care physicians and 84 patients with common somatic symptoms. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, with role, gender, and consultation phase as predictors.RESULTS Of the 2,405 interruptions observed, 82.9% were cooperative. Among physicians, men were more likely to make an intrusive interruption than women (3 = 0.43; SE, 0.21; odds ratio [OR] = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.31), whereas among patients, men were less likely to make an intrusive interruption than women (3 = -0.35; SE, 0.17; OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98). Patients' interruptions were more likely to be intrusive than physicians' interrup-tions in the phase of problem presentation (3 = 0.71; SE, 0.23; OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.30-3.20), but not in the phase of diagnosis and/or treatment plan discussion (3 = -0.17; SE, 0.15; OR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.15).CONCLUSIONS Most interruptions in clinical interaction are cooperative and may enhance the interaction. The nature of physicians' and patients' interruptions is the result of an inter-play between role, gender, and consultation phase.Ann Fam Med 2022;20:423-429. https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2846	[Plug, Ilona; Stommel, Wyke; Das, Enny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Language Studies, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Dulmen, Sandra; Hartman, Tim C.

However, the relation between multimodal encoding of motion events in speech and gesture, and memory is not yet fully understood. Moreover, whether language typology modulates this relation remains to be tested. This study investigates whether the type of motion event information (path or manner) mentioned in speech and gesture predicts which information is remembered and whether this varies across speakers of typologically different languages. Dutch- and Turkish-speakers watched and described motion events and completed a surprise recognition memory task. For both Dutch- and Turkish-speakers, manner memory was at chance level. Participants who mentioned path in speech during encoding were more accurate at detecting changes to the path in the memory task. The relation between mentioning path in speech and path memory did not vary cross-linguistically. Finally, the co-speech gesture did not predict memory above mentioning path in speech. These findings suggest that how speakers describe a motion event in speech is more important than the typology of the speakers' native language in predicting motion event memory.

Many people enjoy engaging with fiction every day. Here we focus on literary reading as 1 instance of fiction consumption from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. The brain processes which play a role in the mental construction of fiction worlds and the related engagement with fictional characters, remain largely unknown. The authors discuss the neurocognitive poetics model (Jacobs, 2015a) of literary reading specifying the likely neuronal correlates of several key processes in literary reading, namely inference and situation model building, immersion, mental simulation and imagery, figurative language and style, and the issue of distinguishing fact from fiction. An overview of recent work on these key processes is followed by a discussion of methodological challenges in studying the brain bases of fiction processing.

Here we introduce two Wav2Vec2-based models for both text-dependent and text-independent phone-to-audio alignment. The proposed Wav2Vec2-FS, a semi-supervised model, directly learns phone-to-audio alignment through contrastive learning and a forward sum loss, and can be coupled with a pretrained phone recognizer to achieve text-independent alignment. The other model, Wav2Vec2-FC, is a frame classification model trained on forced aligned labels that can both perform forced alignment and text-independent segmentation. Evaluation results suggest that both proposed methods, even when transcriptions are not available, generate highly close results to existing forced alignment tools. Our work presents a neural pipeline of fully automated phone-to-audio alignment. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/lingjzhu/charsiu.

Previous research on the Lombard intelligibility benefit focused almost entirely on how native speakers produce and perceive Lombard speech. In this study, we investigate the size of the Lombard intelligibility benefit of both native (American-English) and non-native (native Dutch) English for native and non-native listeners (Dutch and Spanish). We used a glimpsing metric to measure the energetic masking potential of speech, which predicted that both native and non-native Lombard speech could withstand greater amounts of masking to a similar extent, compared to plain speech. In an intelligibility experiment, native English, Spanish, and Dutch listeners listened to the same words, mixed with noise. While the non-native listeners appeared to benefit more from Lombard speech than the native listeners did, each listener group experienced a similar benefit for native and non-native Lombard speech. Energetic masking, as captured by the glimpsing metric, only accounted for part of the Lombard benefit, indicating that the Lombard intelligibility benefit does not only result from a shift in spectral distribution. Despite subtle native language influences on non-native Lombard speech, both native and non-native speech provides a Lombard benefit.

Both technologies have only gradually moved in the direction of supporting language learning, and only more recently used for grading purposes. How the speaking construct is defined determines one's evaluation of the extent to which assessments using these technologies are adequate to the task, given different test use contexts, and what the challenges and future research requirements are. In any event there are many opportunities for their use in assessment, and these would be facilitated by increased cross-disciplinary research among the language testing and speech technology communities.

Yet, human communication typically involves an interactional exchange of multimodal signals, such as hand gestures that have different affordances for representing event components. Here, we review recent empirical evidence on multimodal encoding of motion in speech and gesture to gain a deeper understanding of whether and how language typology shapes linguistic expressions in different modalities, and how this changes across different sensory modalities of input and interacts with other aspects of cognition. Empirical evidence strongly suggests that Talmy's typology of event integration predicts multimodal event descriptions in speech and gesture and visual attention to event components prior to producing these descriptions. Furthermore, variability within the event itself, such as type and modality of stimuli, may override the influence of language typology, especially for expression of manner.

Pairs of participants were tested in both the role of the Performer and the Observer. In the literature, an Error Related Negativity (ERN)-Error Positivity (Pe) complex has been identified for performed (ERN-Pe) and observed (oERN-oPe) errors. While these effects have been widely studied for performance errors in speeded decision tasks relying on visual input, relatively little is known about the performance monitoring signa-tures in observed language processing based on auditory input. In the lexical decision task, native Dutch speak-ers listened to real Dutch Words, Non-Words, and crucially, long Pseudowords that resembled words until the final syllable and were shown to be error-prone in a pilot study, because they were responded to too soon. We hypothesised that the errors in the task would result in a response locked ERN-Pe pattern both for the Performer and for the Observer. Our hypothesis regarding the ERN was not supported, however a Pe-like effect, as well as a P300 were present. Analyses to disentangle lexical and error processing similarly indicated a P300 for errors, and the results furthermore pointed to differences between responses before and after word offset. The findings are interpreted as marking attention during error processing during auditory word recognition.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: SI: Error Processing (c) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Kootstra, GJ; Dijkstra, T; van Hell, JG				Kootstra, Gerrit Jan; Dijkstra, Ton; van Hell, Janet G.			Interactive Alignment and Lexical Triggering of Code-Switching in Bilingual Dialogue	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						code-switching; bilingual; interactive alignment; priming; cognates; dialogue	WORD RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE CONTROL; SENTENCE; VOLUNTARY; CHOICE; MECHANISM; ERP	When bilingual speakers use two languages in the same utterance, this is called code-switching. Previous research indicates that bilinguals' likelihood to code-switch is enhanced when the utterance to be produced (1) contains a word with a similar form across languages (lexical triggering) and (2) is preceded by a code-switched utterance, for example from a dialogue partner (interactive alignment/priming of code-switching). Both factors have mostly been tested on corpus data and have not yet been studied in combination. In two experiments, we therefore investigated the combined effects of interactive alignment and lexical triggering on code-switching. In Experiment 1, Dutch-English bilinguals described pictures to each other in a dialogue game where a confederate's code-switching was manipulated. The participants were free to use either Dutch, English, or a combination of Dutch and English in describing the pictures, so they could voluntarily code-switch or not. The pictures contained a cognate [e.g.,roos(rose)], a false friend [e.g.,rok(skirt, false friend withrock)], or a control word [e.g.,jas(coat)]. Participants code-switched more often when the confederate had just code-switched (indicating interactive alignment). They also code-switched more often when cognates were involved, but only when the confederate had just code-switched. This indicates that lexical triggering is driven by interactive alignment. False friends did not enhance the likelihood of code-switching. Experiment 2 used a similar dialogue game with participants from the same population but focused specifically on how to account for interactive alignment of code-switching. Rather than aligning on their dialogue partner's pragmatic act of code-switching, bilinguals aligned on the language activation from the utterance produced by their dialogue partner. All in all, the results show how co-activation of languages at multiple levels of processing together influence bilinguals' tendency to code-switch. The findings call for a perspective on bilingual language production in which cross-speaker and cross-language processes are combined.

However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Muller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture-meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign). This database includes a list of the most systematic silent gestures in the group of participants, a notation of the form of each gesture based on four features (hand configuration, orientation, placement, and movement), each gesture's mode of representation, iconicity ratings, and professionally filmed videos that can be used for experimental and clinical endeavors.

The processing of the Dutch masculine generic <i>zijn</i> 'his' across stereotype contexts: An eye-tracking study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FAIR JOB DESCRIPTIONS; CHILDRENS PERCEPTIONS; GENDER PERCEPTION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ROLE NOUNS; ROLE NAMES; PRONOUNS; LANGUAGE; IMPACT; INFORMATION	Language users often infer a person's gender when it is not explicitly mentioned. This information is included in the mental model of the described situation, giving rise to expectations regarding the continuation of the discourse. Such gender inferences can be based on two types of information: gender stereotypes (e.g., nurses are female) and masculine generics, which are grammatically masculine word forms that are used to refer to all genders in certain contexts (e.g., To each his own). In this eye-tracking experiment (N = 82), which is the first to systematically investigate the online processing of masculine generic pronouns, we tested whether the frequently used Dutch masculine generic zijn 'his' leads to a male bias. In addition, we tested the effect of context by introducing male, female, and neutral stereotypes. We found no evidence for the hypothesis that the generically-intended masculine pronoun zijn ` his' results in a male bias. However, we found an effect of stereotype context. After introducing a female stereotype, reading about a man led to an increase in processing time. However, the reverse did not hold, which parallels the finding in social psychology that men are penalized more for gender-nonconforming behavior. This suggests that language processing is not only affected by the strength of stereotype contexts; the associated disapproval of violating these gender stereotypes affects language processing, too.

Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast. This conclusion challenges assumptions about the relation between linguistic functions and linguistic structures.

In sign languages, however, the visual-spatial modality allows for iconic encodings (motivated form-meaning mappings) of space in which form and location of the hands bear resemblance to the objects and spatial relations depicted. We assessed whether the iconic encodings in sign languages guide visual attention to spatial relations differently than spatial encodings in spoken languages during message preparation at the sentence level. Using a visual world production eye-tracking paradigm, we compared 20 deaf native signers of Sign-Language-of-the-Netherlands and 20 Dutch speakers' visual attention to describe left versus right configurations of objects (e.g., "pen is to the left/right of cup"). Participants viewed 4-picture displays in which each picture contained the same 2 objects but in different spatial relations (lateral [left/right], sagittal [front/behind], topological [in/on]) to each other. They described the target picture (left/right) highlighted by an arrow. During message preparation, signers, but not speakers, experienced increasing eye-gaze competition from other spatial configurations. This effect was absent during picture viewing prior to message preparation of relational encoding. Moreover, signers' visual attention to lateral and/or sagittal relations was predicted by the type of iconicity (i.e., object and space resemblance vs. space resemblance only) in their spatial descriptions. Findings are discussed in relation to how "thinking for speaking" differs from "thinking for signing" and how iconicity can mediate the link between language and human experience and guides signers' but not speakers' attention to visual aspects of the world.

We show that instead of a discontinuous exponential learning with sigmoidal decay (ELSD) model, a continuous ELSD model had a better fit when applied separately to monolinguals, bilinguals, and early immersion learners. Only for nonimmersion learners and later immersion learners did a discontinuous ELSD model have a better fit, with a critical age of 18.6 and 19.0 years of age, respectively. These age effects can be interpreted as schooling effects. We suggest that personal and societal factors, including differences in living circumstances and socialization, may bring about age-specific discontinuity patterns in language learning and in language learning rate. The implication is that they are not the outcome of cognition-driven developmental factors leading to one or more critical periods.

Recent studies have argued that, in sign languages, depicting strategy like constructed action (CA), in which a signer enacts the referent, is used for referential purposes in narratives. Here, we tested the referential function of CA in a more controlled experimental setting and outside narrative context. Given the iconic properties of CA we hypothesized that this strategy could be used for efficient information transmission. Thus, we asked if use of CA increased with the increase in the information required to be communicated. Twenty-three deaf signers of LIS described unconnected images, which varied in the amount of information represented, to another player in a director-matcher game. Results revealed that participants used CA to communicate core information about the images and also increased the use of CA as images became informatively denser. The findings show that iconic features of CA can be used for referential function in addition to its depictive function outside narrative context and to achieve communicative efficiency.

A drawback of most of these studies is that lexical prediction ('top-down' activation) accounts cannot be distinguished conclusively from lexical integration ('bottom-up' activation) accounts. Here we explored whether it is possible to distinguish integration and prediction accounts of ERP N400 modulations in language processing through experimental design. By employing rhyming sentence completions, we kept the ease of integration constant across conditions that differed in word predictability only. This experimental design allowed us to attribute N400 target word effects across conditions to predictive language processing. We close by discussing recommendations for future electrophysiological studies on prediction in language.

Instead of relying on a manual selection of cases of morphosyntactic variation, we first marshal large bilingual parallel corpora and machine translation software to identify semiautomatically, in an extensively data-driven fashion, loci of variation from various "corners " of Dutch grammar. We then gauge the distribution of con-structional alternatives in a nationally as well as stylistically stratified corpus for a representative selection of twenty alternation patterns. We find that natiolectal variation in the grammar of Dutch is far more prevalent than often assumed, especially in less edited text types, and that it shows up in inflection phenomena, lexically conditioned syntactic variation, and pure word order permutations. Another key finding is that many cases of synchronic probabilistic asymmetries reflect a diachronic difference between the two varieties: Netherlandic Dutch often tends to be ahead in cases of ongoing grammatical change, with Belgian Dutch holding on somewhat longer to obsolescent features of the grammar.

First, we demonstrate that the degree of inherent plurality of concepts, based on individual ratings by non-signers, strongly correlates with the number of hands used in the sign forms encoding the same concepts across sign languages. Second, we show that certain concepts are iconically articulated around specific parts of the body, as predicted by the associational intuitions by non-signers. The implications of our results are both theoretical and methodological. With regard to theoretical implications, we corroborate previous research by demonstrating and quantifying, using a much larger material than previously available, the iconic nature of languages in the visual modality. As for the methodological implications, we show how automatic methods are, in fact, useful for performing large-scale analysis of sign language data, to a high level of accuracy, as indicated by our manual error analysis.

Support from the speech therapy context	LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Speaker evaluation; Speech therapy; Standard language ideology; Competence; Professional discourse	ATTITUDES; ACCENTS; DUTCH	This paper pressure tests the claim that professional speakers who use the standard language are perceived as more competent, by (1) unpacking 'competence'; (2) disentangling the discursive complexity of 'professional speech context'; (3) accounting for respondents' language socialization background. In our experiment, Belgian Dutch speech therapy students (N = 77) and a control group (N = 54) evaluate a speech therapist who does (not) use standard language in relational and transactional professional discourse. Results reveal (1) a more conservative versus a more dynamic conception of 'competence'; (2) penalization of standard language use in informal speech; (3) slightly higher sociolinguistic sensitivity for speech therapy respondents. The perceived tolerance towards non-standard speech in high standard expectancy contexts begs a reconsideration of language ideology in professional communication. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past 20 years, the English (L2) proficiency of this population has considerably increased. To consider the impact of this development on neighborhood effects, we conducted a strict replication of the English lexical decision (ELD) task by van Heuven et al. (1998, Experiment 4). In line with our prediction, English characteristics (neighborhood size, word and bigram frequency) dominated the word and non-word responses, while the non-words also revealed an interaction of English and Dutch neighborhood size. The prominence of English was tested again in two experiments introducing a stronger neighborhood manipulation. In ELD and progressive demasking, English items with no orthographic neighbors at all were contrasted with items having neighbors in English or Dutch ('hermits') only, or in both languages. In both tasks, target processing was affected strongly by the presence of English neighbors, but only weakly by Dutch neighbors. Effects are interpreted in terms of two underlying processing mechanisms: language-specific global lexical activation and lexical competition.

A corpus study of spontaneous conversation, microblog and newspaper discourse	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS			English	Article						subjectivity; Mandarin REASON connective; multi-style discourse	COHERENCE RELATIONS; CAUSAL CONNECTIVES; ENGLISH	Studies in several languages find that causal connectives differ from one another in their prototypical meaning and use, which provides insight into language users' cognitive categorization of causal relations in discourse. Subjectivity plays a vital role in this process. Using an integrated subjectivity approach, this study aims to give a comprehensive picture of the semantic-pragmatic distinctions between Mandarin REASON connectives jiran 'since', yinwei and youya 'because'. The data come from spontaneous conversation, microblog, and newspaper discourse, while most previous studies have focused only on written data. The results show that, despite the contextual differences in discourse from each corpus, the connectives display distinctive and robust profiles. Jiran is subjective. It prototypically expresses speech act and epistemic causalities featuring speech act and judgment in the consequent. Speaker SoC (subject of consciousness) is actively involved yet remains implicit in the utterances. Youyu, by contrast, is objective. It typically expresses volitional and non-volitional content causalities featuring the consequent of physical act and fact, which are usually independent of SoCs. Yinwei is neutral in general, with a slight preference to volitional content and epistemic relations, to the consequent of fact, and to speaker SoC. Only one interaction with discourse style is found: in relations introduced by yinwei, the linguistic realization of the SoC varies across corpora: significantly more implicit yet few explicit cases in microblogs, yet the opposite is true in conversations. The specific profile of yinwei, depending on the ordering of the antecedent and the consequent, is robust across corpora. Furthermore, the relative importance of the associated subjectivity features is determined. In conclusion, the study contributes to our understanding of causal coherence and extends the empirical database that supports the claims of a cognitive account of causal coherence relations.

On metaphorical views, dynamite, and doodlings Functions of domain adjectives in metaphorical domain constructions	REVIEW OF COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article						metaphorical domain constructions; metaphor signalling; deliberate metaphor; domain adjectives; discourse	DELIBERATE; WORDS	This paper offers a systematic, bottom-up, investigation of the role of adjectives as metaphor signals in metaphorical domain constructions (MDCs) such as 'budgetary anorexia' and 'economic crash' within the framework of Deliberate Metaphor Theory (e.g., Steen, 2017). To this end, we analyse all MDCs in the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus. Results of our analyses demonstrate that domain adjectives in MDCs do not by definition constitute signals of metaphor, and that not all nouns in MDCs are identified as potentially deliberate metaphors. We identify three different functions of domain adjectives: (1) signal of novel metaphor; (2) signal of conventional metaphor; (3) non-signal. The analyses in this paper provide new insights into both the role of domain adjectives in MDCs, and the position of MDCs as a typical manifestation of potentially deliberate metaphor.

Two English identity priming experiments were conducted with native English, Dutch non-native, and Spanish non-native listeners. In Experiment 1, primes and targets were spoken in the same or a different voice. Only the native listeners showed exemplar effects. In Experiment 2, primes and targets had the same or a different degree of vowel reduction. The Dutch, but not the Spanish, listeners were familiar with this reduction pattern from their L1 phonology. In this experiment, exemplar effects only arose for the Spanish listeners. We propose that in these lexical decision experiments the use of exemplars is co-determined by listeners' available processing resources, which is modulated by the familiarity with the variation type from their L1 phonology. The use of exemplars differs between native and non-native listening, suggesting qualitative differences between native and non-native speech comprehension processes.

A quantitative analysis of linguistic markers	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH			English	Article						General practice; Linguistic analysis; Observational coding; Unexplained symptoms	PRIMARY-CARE CONSULTATIONS; PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS; RESPONSES; CONCRETENESS; PERSPECTIVES; PERCEPTION; WOMEN; CFS; SAY	Objective: Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are believed to have a deviant way of talking about complaints. This study systematically compared linguistic markers in symptom presentations of patients with MUS and medically explained symptoms (MES). Methods: This content analysis (cross-sectional study) conceptualized relevant linguistic markers based on previous research about MUS communication. Linguistic markers included negations ("not"), intensifiers ("very"), diminishers ("a little"), first or third person subject ("I" vs. "my body"), subjectivity markers ("I think") and abstraction ("I'm gasping for breath" vs. "I'm short of breath"). We also coded valence, reference to physical or mental states, and consultation phase. We compared 41 MUS and 41 MES transcribed video-recorded general practice consultations. Data were analyzed with binary random intercepts models. Results: We selected and coded 2752 relevant utterances. Patients with MUS used less diminishers compared to patients with MES, but this main effect disappeared when consultation phase was included as predictor. For all other linguistic variables, the analyses did not reveal any variation in language use based on whether patients had MUS or MES. Importantly, utterances' valence and reference to physical or mental state did predict the use of linguistic markers. Conclusion: We observed no systematic variations in linguistic markers for patients who suffered from MUS compared to MES. Patients varied their language use based on utterances' valence and reference to physical or mental states. Current ideas about deviant patient communication may be based on stigmatized perceptions of how patients with MUS communicate, rather than actual differences in their talk.

The present study used conversation analysis to examine how general practitioners (GPs) ascribe psychosocial causes to patients' unexplained symptoms during medical consultations. Our data consisted of 36 recorded consultations from Dutch general practice. We found that GPs raise psychosocial concerns as a potential cause of MUS in 14 consultations, either captured in 1) history-taking questions, or 2) diagnostic explanations. Whereas questions invited patient ideas, explanations did not make relevant patient responses in adjacent turns and subordinated patients' knowledge in symptom experiences to the GP's medical expertise. By questioning patients whether their symptoms may have psychosocial causes GPs enabled symptom explanations to be constructed collaboratively. Furthermore, additional data exploration showed that GPs lay ground for psychosocial ascriptions by first introducing psychosocial concerns as a consequence rather than a cause of complaints. Such preliminary activities allowed GPs to initiate rather delicate psychosocial ascriptions later in the consultation.

Cross-modal associations and synesthesia: Categorical perception and structure in vowel-color mappings in a large online sample	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Synesthesia; Cross-modal correspondences; Language; Sound symbolism	SYNAESTHESIA; SOUND; PREVALENCE	We report associations between vowel sounds, graphemes, and colors collected online from over 1,000 Dutch speakers. We also provide open materials, including a Python implementation of the structure measure and code for a single-page web application to run simple cross-modal tasks. We also provide a full dataset of color-vowel associations from 1,164 participants, including over 200 synesthetes identified using consistency measures. Our analysis reveals salient patterns in the cross-modal associations and introduces a novel measure of isomorphism in cross-modal mappings. We found that, while the acoustic features of vowels significantly predict certain mappings (replicating prior work), both vowel phoneme category and grapheme category are even better predictors of color choice. Phoneme category is the best predictor of color choice overall, pointing to the importance of phonological representations in addition to acoustic cues. Generally, high/front vowels are lighter, more green, and more yellow than low/back vowels. Synesthetes respond more strongly on some dimensions, choosing lighter and more yellow colors for high and mid front vowels than do nonsynesthetes. We also present a novel measure of cross-modal mappings adapted from ecology, which uses a simulated distribution of mappings to measure the extent to which participants' actual mappings are structured isomorphically across modalities. Synesthetes have mappings that tend to be more structured than nonsynesthetes', and more consistent color choices across trials correlate with higher structure scores. Nevertheless, the large majority (similar to 70%) of participants produce structured mappings, indicating that the capacity to make isomorphically structured mappings across distinct modalities is shared to a large extent, even if the exact nature of the mappings varies across individuals. Overall, this novel structure measure suggests a distribution of structured cross-modal association in the population, with synesthetes at one extreme and participants with unstructured associations at the other.

J	Blok, DJ; Simoski, B; van Woudenberg, TJ; Buijzen, M				Blok, David J.; Simoski, Bojan; van Woudenberg, Thabo J.; Buijzen, Moniek			The Usefulness of Web-Based Communication Data for Social Network Health Interventions: Agent-Based Modeling Study	JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING			English	Article						agent-based modeling; peer nomination network data; physical activity; social network analysis; social network interventions; web-based communication network data	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ONLINE; BEHAVIOR; BIAS	Background: Social network interventions are an effective approach to promote physical activity. These interventions are traditionally designed using self-reported peer nomination network data to represent social connections. However, there is unexplored potential in communication data exchanged through web-based messaging apps or social platforms, given the availability of these data, the developments in artificial intelligence to analyze these data, and the shift of personal communication to the web sphere. The implications of using web-based versus offline social networks on the effectiveness of social network interventions remain largely unexplored. Objective: This study aims to investigate the differences in the impact of social network interventions on physical activity levels (PALs) between networks derived from web-based communication and peer nomination data. Methods: We used the data on sociometric questionnaires, messages from a web-based communication app, and PAL (number of steps per day) of 408 participants in 21 school classes. We applied social network analysis to identify influential peers and agent-based modeling to simulate the diffusion of PAL and explore the impact of social network interventions on PAL among adolescents in school classes. Influential peers (n=63) were selected based on centrality measures (ie, in-degree, closeness, and betweenness) to spread the intervention. They received health education, which increased their PAL by 17%. In sensitivity analyses, we tested the impact of a 5%, 10%, and 20% increase in PAL among influential peers. Results: There was a 24%-27% overlap in selected influential peers between the 2 network representations. In general, the simulations showed that interventions could increase PAL by 5.0%-5.8% within 2 months. However, the predicted median impact on PAL was slightly higher in networks based on web-based communication data than peer nomination data for in-degree (5.7%, and closeness centrality (5.8%, IQR 5.6%-6.1% vs 5.3%, IQR 5.0%-5.6%; P<.001). A large variation in impact was observed between school classes (range 1.5%-17.5%). Lowering the effectiveness of health education from 17% to 5% would reduce the overall impact of the social network intervention by 3-fold in both networks. Conclusions: Our findings showed that network interventions based on web-based communication data could increase PAL. Web-based communication data may therefore be a valuable addition to peer nomination data for future social network intervention design. Artificial intelligence methods, including agent-based modeling, can help to design these network interventions and provide insights into the role of network characteristics in their effectiveness.

We have curated a G2P dataset from various sources that covers around 100 languages and trained large-scale multilingual G2P models based on ByT5. We found that ByT5 operating on byte-level inputs significantly outperformed the tokenbased mT5 model in terms of multilingual G2P. Pairwise comparison with monolingual models in these languages suggests that multilingual ByT5 models generally lower the phone error rate by jointly learning from a variety of languages. The pretrained model can further benefit low resource G2P through zero-shot prediction on unseen languages or provides pretrained weights for finetuning, which helps the model converge to a lower phone error rate than randomly initialized weights. To facilitate future research on multilingual G2P, we make available our code and pretrained multilingual G2P models at: https: //github.com/lingjzhu/CharsiuG2P.

Expectations from relative clauses: Real-time coherence updates in discourse processing	COGNITION			English	Article							IMPLICIT CAUSALITY; VERB	When processing a text, comprehenders use available cues to anticipate both upcoming content and the dependencies that comprise the structure of the growing discourse. In an eye-tracking while reading experiment, we test discourse updating in passages in which dependencies are implicit and the segments convey content that is not required to participate in any coherence-driven inference. This study provides strong evidence of comprehenders' ability to build implicit non-obligatory discourse structure in real time.	[Hoek, Jet; Evers-Vermeul, Jacqueline; Sanders, Ted J.

We investigated this in two word recognition experiments in L1, using homophonic near-cognates that are spelled in L2. In a German lexical decision task (Experiment 1), German-Dutch bilinguals had more difficulties to reject these Dutch-spelled near-cognates than other misspellings, while this was not the case for non-Dutch speaking Germans. In Experiment 2, the same materials were embedded in German sentences. Analyses of eye movements during reading showed that only non-Dutch speaking Germans, but not Dutch-speaking participants were slowed down by the Dutch cognate misspellings. Additionally, in both experiments, bilinguals with larger vocabulary sizes in Dutch tended to show larger near-cognate effects. Thus, Dutch word knowledge influenced word recognition in L1 German in both task contexts, suggesting that L1 word recognition in bilinguals is non-selective with respect to L2.

However, how a listener allocates visual attention to these articulators during speech comprehension is unknown. We used eye-tracking to investigate whether and how native and highly proficient non-native listeners of Dutch allocated overt eye gaze to visible speech and gestures during clear and degraded speech comprehension. Participants watched video clips of an actress uttering a clear or degraded (6-band noise-vocoded) action verb while performing a gesture or not, and were asked to indicate the word they heard in a cued-recall task. Gestural enhancement was the largest (i.e., a relative reduction in reaction time cost) when speech was degraded for all listeners, but it was stronger for native listeners. Both native and non-native listeners mostly gazed at the face during comprehension, but non-native listeners gazed more often at gestures than native listeners. However, only native but not non-native listeners' gaze allocation to gestures predicted gestural benefit during degraded speech comprehension. We conclude that non-native listeners might gaze at gesture more as it might be more challenging for non-native listeners to resolve the degraded auditory cues and couple those cues to phonological information that is conveyed by visible speech. This diminished phonological knowledge might hinder the use of semantic information that is conveyed by gestures for non-native compared to native listeners. Our results demonstrate that the degree of language experience impacts overt visual attention to visual articulators, resulting in different visual benefits for native versus non-native listeners.

We explain how linguistic and gestural cues guide the representation of narrative time progression and argue that this representation involves various cognitive operations regulating the alignment between the viewpoints of narrator, addressee, and narrative characters. These operations are steered by a variety of linguistic phenomena, including verb tense, adverbs, demonstratives, reduplication and negation, as well as body partitioning. We discuss how genre characteristics influence the relation between the linguistic and cognitive representation of time and viewpoint. Finally, we explain how the analyses presented in the various papers both demonstrate and clarify how the cognitive representation of time in narrative discourse relies on the human capacity to simultaneously manage multiple viewpoints, leading to the conclusion that time and viewpoint are closely related in the representation of narrative discourse.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; 1ST YEAR; ADULTS; 2ND-LANGUAGE; DISCRIMINATION	The aim of this study was to investigate whether early-English education benefits the perception of English phonetic contrasts that are known to be perceptually confusable for Dutch native speakers, comparing Dutch pupils who were enrolled in an early-English programme at school from the age of four with pupils in a mainstream programme with English instruction from the age of 11, and English-Dutch early bilingual children. Children were 4-5-year-olds (start of primary school), 8-9-year-olds, or 11-12-year-olds (end of primary school). Children were tested on four contrasts that varied in difficulty: /b/-/s/ (easy), /k/-/g/ (intermediate), /f/-/theta/ (difficult), /epsilon/-/ae/ (very difficult). Bilingual children outperformed the two other groups on all contrasts except /b/-/s/. Early-English pupils did not outperform mainstream pupils on any of the contrasts. This shows that early-English education as it is currently implemented is not beneficial for pupils' perception of non-native contrasts.

The adoptees' relearning advantages have been argued to be conferred by lasting birth-language knowledge obtained from the early exposure. However, it is also plausible to assume that the advantages may arise from adoptees' superior ability to learn language sounds in general, as a result of their unusual linguistic experience, i.e., exposure to multiple languages in sequence early in life. If this is the case, then the adoptees' relearning benefits should generalize to previously unheard language sounds, rather than be limited to their birth-language sounds. In the present study, adult Korean adoptees in the Netherlands and matched Dutch-native controls were trained on identifying a Japanese length distinction to which they had never been exposed before. The adoptees and Dutch controls did not differ on any test carried out before, during, or after the training, indicating that observed adoptee advantages for birth-language relearning do not generalize to novel, previously unheard language sounds. The finding thus fails to support the suggestion that birth-language relearning advantages may arise from enhanced ability to learn language sounds in general conferred by early experience in multiple languages. Rather, our finding supports the original contention that such advantages involve memory traces obtained before adoption.

Insights into embodied cognition and mental imagery from aphantasia	NATURE REVIEWS PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WORD RECOGNITION; SPATIAL IMAGERY; TACTILE IMAGERY; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; SIMULATION	Mental representations allow humans to think about, remember and communicate about an infinite number of concepts. A key question within cognitive psychology is how the mind stores and accesses the meaning of concepts. Embodied theories propose that concept knowledge includes or requires simulations of the sensory and physical interactions of one's body with the world, even when a concept is subsequently processed in a context unrelated to those interactions. However, the nature of these simulations is highly debated and their mechanisms underspecified. Insight into whether and how simulations support concept knowledge can be derived from studying related mental representations, such as mental imagery. In particular, research into the inability to form mental imagery, known as aphantasia, can advance understanding of mental imagery and mental simulations. In this Review, we provide an overview of embodied theories of cognition, review research in mental imagery and consider how simulation and mental imagery might overlap. We then synthesize the growing aphantasia literature and discuss how aphantasia can be used to test predictions derived from theories of embodied cognition. Embodied theories propose that concept knowledge involves simulations of sensory information. In this Review, Muraki et al. discuss how studying individuals with an inability to form mental images can provide insight into the relationship between mental imagery and these mental simulations.

In parallel, connectionist modeling has extended our knowledge of the processes engaged in semantic activation. However, these two lines of investigation have rarely been brought together. Here, we describe a processing model based on distributional semantics in which activation spreads throughout a semantic network, as dictated by the patterns of semantic similarity between words. We show that the activation profile of the network, measured at various time points, can successfully account for response times in lexical and semantic decision tasks, as well as for subjective concreteness and imageability ratings. We also show that the dynamics of the network is predictive of performance in relational semantic tasks, such as similarity/relatedness rating. Our results indicate that bringing together distributional semantic networks and spreading of activation provides a good fit to both automatic lexical processing (as indexed by lexical and semantic decisions) as well as more deliberate processing (as indexed by ratings), above and beyond what has been reported for previous models that take into account only similarity resulting from network structure.

We used MEG to investigate how oscillatory dynamics support speech-gesture integration when integration load is manipulated by auditory (e.g., speech degradation) and visual semantic (e.g., gesture congruency) factors. Participants were presented with videos of an actress uttering an action verb in clear or degraded speech, accompanied by a matching (mixing gesture + mixing) or mismatching (drinking gesture + walking) gesture. In clear speech, alpha/beta power was more suppressed in the left inferior frontal gyrus and motor and visual cortices when integration load increased in response to mismatching versus matching gestures. In degraded speech, beta power was less suppressed over posterior STS and medial temporal lobe for mismatching compared with matching gestures, showing that integration load was lowest when speech was degraded and mismatching gestures could not be integrated and disambiguate the degraded signal. Our results thus provide novel insights on how low-frequency oscillatory modulations in different parts of the cortex support the semantic audiovisual integration of gestures in clear and degraded speech: When speech is clear, the left inferior frontal gyrus and motor and visual cortices engage because higher-level semantic information increases semantic integration load. When speech is degraded, posterior STS/middle temporal gyrus and medial temporal lobe are less engaged because integration load is lowest when visual semantic information does not aid lexical retrieval and speech and gestures cannot be integrated.

However, they are somewhat likely to switch in the progressive structure between the Spanish auxiliary estar ("to be") and the participle ("Ella esta voting"; "She is voting"). This phenomenon is known as the "auxiliary phrase asymmetry". One hypothesis as to why this occurs is that estar has more semantic weight as it also functions as an independent verb, whereas haber is almost exclusively used as an auxiliary verb. To test this hypothesis, we employed a connectionist model that produces spontaneous code-switches. Through simulation experiments, we showed that i) the asymmetry emerges in the model and that ii) the asymmetry disappears when using haber also as a main verb, which adds semantic weight. Therefore, the lack of semantic weight of haber may indeed cause the asymmetry.

Less is known about the development of language soon after language exposure and if late exposure hinders all domains of language in children and adults. We compared late signing adults and children (MAge = 8;5) 2 years after exposure to sign language, to their age-matched native signing peers in expressions of two types of locative relations that are acquired in certain cognitive-developmental order: view-independent (IN-ON-UNDER) and view-dependent (LEFT-RIGHT). Late signing children and adults differed from native signers in their use of linguistic devices for view-dependent relations but not for view-independent relations. These effects were also modulated by the morphological complexity. Hindering effects of late language exposure on the development of language in children and adults are not absolute but are modulated by cognitive and linguistic complexity.

Here we take stock of experimental work on iconicity and present a double special issue with a diverse set of new contributions. We contextualise the work by introducing a typology of approaches to iconicity in language. Some approaches construe iconicity as a discrete property that is either present or absent; others treat it as involving semiotic relationships that come in kinds; and yet others see it as a gradient substance that comes in degrees. We show the benefits and limitations that come with each of these construals and stress the importance of developing accounts that can fluently switch between them. With operationalisations of iconicity that are well defined yet flexible enough to deal with differences in tasks, modalities, and levels of analysis, experimental research on iconicity is well equipped to contribute to a comprehensive science of language.

Anticipointment Detection in Event Tweets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Event detection; emotion detection; Twitter		We developed a system to detect positive expectation, disappointment, and satisfaction in tweets that refer to events automatically discovered in the Twitter stream. The emotional content shared on Twitter when referring to public events can provide insights into the presumed and experienced quality of the event. We expected to find a connection between positive expectation and disappointment, a succession that is referred to as anticipointment. The application of computational approaches makes it possible to detect the presence and strength of this hypothetical relation for a large number of events. We extracted events from a longitudinal dataset of Dutch Twitter posts, and modeled classifiers to detect emotion in the tweets related to those events by means of hashtag-labeled training data. After classifying all tweets before and after the events in our dataset, we summarized the collective emotions for over 3000 events as the percentage of tweets classified as positive expectation (in anticipation), disappointment and satisfaction (in hindsight). Only a weak correlation of around 0.2 was found between positive expectation and disappointment, while a higher correlation of 0.6 was found between positive expectation and satisfaction. The most anticipointing events were events with a clear loss, such as a canceled event or when the favored sports team had lost. We conclude that senders of Twitter posts might be more inclined to share satisfaction than disappointment after a much anticipated event.

J	Tao, HY; Hu, JF				Tao, Hongyin; Hu, Junfei			Structural, semantic, and pragmatic properties of <i>nong</i> constructions in Mandarin discourse: Evidence from corpora	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS			Chinese	Article						nong; transitivity; semantic prosody; informality; complement		This paper extends a previous study on the use patterns of the so-called light verb nong in three types of discourse genres: natural speech (telephone conversation), TV show (sitcom), and written text. Corpus findings show that, in addition to the reported low transitivity clauses where there is either one argument expressed or no arguments at all, nong constructions with elaborate verbal predicates with a rich set of complements and adverbials and other adjunct elements are dominant in corpora. These features correlate with negative affective stance and high degrees of subjectivity, in additional to features of informality. Together they are taken as co-varying features in highly interactive discourse contexts for designated communicative goals. Methodologically, this paper shows that it is important to examine verbs and argument structure based on corpus data and with an expanded view.

Uncertainty in complex healthcare settings-The need for a comprehensive approach	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Editorial Material						Uncertainty; Transgender care; Adolescents; Ethics; Conversation analysis	MEDICAL-TREATMENT; TRANSGENDER; ADOLESCENTS; INTOLERANCE	Uncertainty is increasingly recognized as a crucial phenomenon throughout medical practice. Research on un-certainty so far has been scattered across disciplines, leading to a lack of consensus about what uncertainty represents and minimal integration of knowledge obtained within isolated disciplines. Currently, a compre-hensive view of uncertainty which does justice to normatively or interactionally challenging healthcare settings is lacking. This impedes research teasing apart when and how uncertainty manifests, how all stakeholders experience and value it, and how it affects medical communication and decision-making. In this paper, we argue that we need a more integrated understanding of uncertainty. We illustrate our argument using the context of adolescent transgender care, in which uncertainty occurs in myriad ways. We first sketch how theories of uncertainty have emerged from isolated disciplines, leading to a lack of conceptual integration. Subsequently, we emphasize why it is problematic that no comprehensive approach to uncertainty has yet been developed, using examples from adolescent transgender care. Finally, we advocate an integrated approach of uncertainty to further advance empirical research and to ultimately benefit clinical practice.	[Oerlemans, Anke J. M.; Cuijpers, Floor A.

This process is called lexically-guided perceptual learning. Moreover, the presence of noise in the speech signal has previously been shown to change the word competition process by increasing the number of candidate words competing for recognition and slowing down the recognition process. Given that reliable lexical information should be available quickly to induce lexically-guided perceptual learning and that word recognition is slowed down in the presence of noise, and especially so for non-native listeners, the present study investigated whether noise interferes with lexically-guided perceptual learning in native and non-native listening. Native English and Dutch listeners were exposed to a story in English in clean speech or with stretches of noise. All the /l/ and /o/ sounds in the story were replaced with an ambiguous sound half-way between /l/ and /o/. Although noise altered the pattern of responses for the non-native listeners in a subsequent phonetic categorization task, both native and non-native listeners demonstrated lexically-guided perceptual learning in both clean and noisy listening conditions. We argue that the robustness of perceptual learning in the presence of intermittent noise for both native and non-native listeners is additional evidence for the remarkable flexibility of native and non-native perceptual systems even in adverse listening conditions.

Assessing the Availability Heuristic and Resistance as Cognitive Mechanisms Underlying the Persuasive Effects of Vaccination Narratives	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						childhood immunization; narrative persuasion; availability heuristic; cognitive resistance; vaccination attitudes; attitude certainty; vaccine hesitancy; belief consistency	RISK PERCEPTION; OMISSION BIAS; DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; ATTITUDE; BELIEFS; INFORMATION; VACCINES; PARENTS; CONTEXT	Online vaccine-critical sentiments are often expressed in appealing personal narratives, whereas vaccine-supporting information is often presented in a non-narrative, expository mode describing scientific facts. In two experiments, we empirically test whether and how these different formats impact the way in which readers process and retrieve information about childhood vaccination, and how this may impact their perceptions regarding vaccination. We assess two psychological mechanisms that are hypothesized to underlie the persuasive nature of vaccination narratives: the availability heuristic (experiment 1, N = 418) and cognitive resistance (experiment 2, N = 403). The results of experiment 1 showed no empirical evidence for the availability heuristic, but exploratory analyses did indicate that an anti-vaccination narrative (vs. expository) might reduce cognitive resistance, decrease vaccination attitudes and reduce attitude certainty in a generally pro-vaccination sample, especially for those who were more vaccine hesitant. Preregistered experiment 2 formally tested this and showed that not narrative format, but prior vaccine hesitancy predicts cognitive resistance and post-reading attitudes. Hesitant participants showed less resistance toward an anti-vaccine text than vaccine-supporting participants, as well as less positive post-reading attitudes and attitude certainty. These findings demonstrate belief consistency effects rather than narrative persuasion, which has implications for scientific research as well as public health policy.

Conceptual similarity and visual metaphor: effects on viewing times, appreciation, and recall	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION			English	Article						visual metaphor; hyponymy; pragmatics; experiment; cognitive processing; Fluency Theory; visual rhetoric; juxtaposition	PLEASURE; MODEL; INTEGRATION; COMPLEXITY; LANGUAGE; FLUENCY; SIMILE; SHAPE; AD	Different levels of conceptual similarity in equivalent visual structures may determine the way meaning is attributed to images. The degree to which two depicted objects are of the same kind limits interpretive possibilities. In the current research, visual hyponyms (objects of the same kind) were contrasted with visual metaphors and unrelated object pairs. Hyponyms are conceptually more similar than metaphor's source and target, or two unrelated objects. Metaphorically related objects share a ground for comparison that lacks between unrelated objects. We expected viewers to interpret hyponyms more quickly than metaphors or unrelated objects. For liking, there were competing predictions: hyponyms are appreciated more because they are easier, or metaphors are liked more because successful cognitive effort is rewarded. In the first experiment viewers were asked to identify relationships in 27 object pairs. Hyponyms were identified faster than metaphors and metaphors faster than unrelated objects. In the second experiment, with the same materials, viewers were asked to rate appreciation for each object pair. This reduced viewing times substantially. Appreciation was higher for hyponyms than for visual metaphors. In a third experiment with the same materials, exposure duration was varied. Hyponyms were preferred to metaphors and unrelated objects irrespective of exposure duration.

This has been attributed to a diminution of olfaction in trade-off to vision [5-10]. This presumption has been challenged recently by data from the hunter-gatherer Jahai who, unlike English speakers, find odors as easy to name as colors [4]. Is the superior olfactory performance among the Jahai because of their ecology (tropical rainforest), their language family (Aslian), or because of their subsistence (they are hunter-gatherers)? We provide novel evidence from the hunter-gatherer Semaq Beri and the non-hunter-gatherer (swidden-horticulturalist) Semelai that subsistence is the critical factor. Semaq Beri and Semelai speakers-who speak closely related languages and live in the tropical rainforest of the Malay Peninsula-took part in a controlled odor-and color-naming experiment. The swidden-horticulturalist Semelai found odors much more difficult to name than colors, replicating the typical Western finding. But for the hunter-gatherer Semaq Beri odor naming was as easy as color naming, suggesting that hunter-gatherer olfactory cognition is special.

J	Hoek, J; Kehler, A; Rohde, H				Hoek, Jet; Kehler, Andrew; Rohde, Hannah			Pronominalization and Expectations for Re-Mention: Modeling Coreference in Contexts With Three Referents	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION			English	Article						coreference; pronoun production; pronoun interpretation; benefactives; ambiguity; bayesian coreference	THEMATIC ROLES; DISCOURSE; COHERENCE; CHOICE; SPEAKERS; FORM	The relationship between pronoun production and pronoun interpretation has been proposed to follow Bayesian principles, combining a comprehender's expectation about which referent will be mentioned next and their estimate of how likely it is that a potential referent will be re-mentioned using a pronoun. The Bayesian Model has received support from studies in several languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Catalan, German), but tested contexts have been limited to two event participants, whereas natural language discourse often involves contexts with more than two event participants. In this study, we conducted three story continuation experiments to assess how the Bayesian Model performs in more complex contexts. Our results show that even in contexts with three event participants, comprehenders can behave rationally when interpreting pronouns, but that they appear to require sufficient context to build up a coherent representation of the situation to do so. In addition to testing the basic claim of the Bayesian Model (Weak Bayes), we test the central prediction of the Strong form of the hypothesis: that the two components of the model (next-mention expectations and choice of referring expression) are influenced by dissociated sets of factors. In a model comparison, Experiments 2 and 3 confirm the closest fit from the Bayesian Model, which supports Weak Bayes, and none of our experiments find evidence that the predictability of a referent affects pronominalization rates, which corroborates Strong Bayes. Finally, we test whether the rate of pronominalization is sensitive to factors related to ambiguity and argument/adjunct status of referents; we find that participants vary their production of pronouns most strongly based on the grammatical role of the antecedent (subject or not), with a smaller effect from the presence/absence of a gender-matched competitor and no effect from the syntactic position of this competing referent.

Consequently, most viewers need to be re-immersed in the story before watching a new season. Although discussions with friends and family can help, we observe that most viewers make extensive use of summaries to re-engage with the plot. Automatic generation of video summaries of TV series' complex stories requires, first, modeling the dynamics of the plot and, second, extracting relevant sequences. In this paper, we tackle plot modeling by considering the social network of interactions between the characters involved in the narrative: substantial, durable changes in a major character's social environment suggest a new development relevant for the summary. Once identified, these major stages in each character's storyline can be used as a basis for completing the summary with related sequences. Our algorithm combines such social network analysis with filmmaking grammar to automatically generate character-oriented video summaries of TV series from partially annotated data. We carry out evaluation with a user study in a real-world scenario: a large sample of viewers were asked to rank video summaries centered on five characters of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, a few weeks before the new, sixth season was released. Our results reveal the ability of character-oriented summaries to re-engage viewers in television series and confirm the contributions of modeling the plot content and exploiting stylistic patterns to identify salient sequences.

In this study, we investigated how expert knowledge and daily experience affect the ability to name odors in a group of experts that has not previously been investigated in this context-Iranian herbalists; also called attars-as well as cooks and laypeople. We assessed naming accuracy and consistency for 16 herb and spice odors, collected judgments of odor perception, and evaluated participants' odor meta-awareness. Participants' responses were overall more consistent and accurate for more frequent and familiar odors. Moreover, attars were more accurate than both cooks and laypeople at naming odors, although cooks did not perform significantly better than laypeople. Attars' perceptual ratings of odors and their overall odor meta-awareness suggest they are also more attuned to odors than the other two groups. To conclude, Iranian attars-but not cooks-are better odor namers than laypeople. They also have greater meta-awareness and differential perceptual responses to odors. These findings further highlight the critical role that expertise and type of experience have on olfactory functions.

This perceptual learning is driven by lexical information. The aim of this paper is two-fold: investigate whether a deep neural network-based (DNN) ASR system can adapt to only a few examples of ambiguous speech as humans have been found to do; investigate a DNN's ability to serve as a model of human perceptual learning. Crucially, we do so by looking at intermediate levels of phoneme category adaptation rather than at the output level. We visualize the activations in the hidden layers of the DNN during perceptual learning. The results show that, similar to humans, DNN systems learn speaker-adapted phone category boundaries from a few labeled examples. The DNN adapts its category boundaries not only by adapting the weights of the output layer, but also by adapting the implicit feature maps computed by the hidden layers, suggesting the possibility that human perceptual learning might involve a similar nonlinear distortion of a perceptual space that is intermediate between the acoustic input and the phonological categories. Comparisons between DNNs and humans can thus provide valuable insights into the way humans process speech and improve ASR technology.

Despite their prescriptive ungrammaticality, they can occur rather frequently. One such example is the comparative construction in Dutch and similarly in German, where the equative particle is used in comparative constructions instead of the prescriptively correct comparative particle (Dutch beter als Jan and German besser wie Jan "lit. better as John"). In a series of three experiments using sentence-matching and eye-tracking methodology, we investigated whether this grammatical norm violation is processed as grammatical, as ungrammatical, or whether it falls in between these two. We hypothesized that the latter would be the case. We analyzed our data using linear mixed effects models in order to capture possible individual differences. The results of the sentence-matching experiments, which were conducted in both Dutch and German, showed that the grammatical norm violation patterns with ungrammatical sentences in both languages. Our hypothesis was therefore not borne out. However, using the more sensitive eye-tracking method on Dutch speakers only, we found that the ungrammatical alternative leads to higher reading times than the grammatical norm violation. We also found significant individual variation regarding this very effect. We furthermore replicated the processing difference between the grammatical norm violation and the prescriptively correct variant. In summary, we conclude that while the results of the more sensitive eye-tracking experiment suggest that the grammatical norm violation is not processed completely on a par with ungrammatical sentences, the results of all three experiments clearly show that the grammatical norm violation cannot be considered grammatical, either.

The impact of speaking style on speech recognition in quiet and multi-talker babble in adult cochlear implant users	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							CLEAR SPEECH; PERCEPTION; INTELLIGIBILITY; HEARING; VOWEL; LISTENERS; FREQUENCY; NOISE; FORMS	The current study examined sentence recognition across speaking styles (conversational, neutral, and clear) in quiet and multi-talker babble (MTB) for cochlear implant (CI) users and normal-hearing listeners under CI simulations. Listeners demonstrated poorer recognition accuracy in MTB than in quiet, but were relatively more accurate with clear speech overall. Within CI users, higher-performing participants were also more accurate in MTB when listening to clear speech. Lower performing users' accuracy was not impacted by speaking style. Clear speech may facilitate recognition in MTB for high-performing users, who may be better able to take advantage of clear speech cues.

This study assessed if this pattern also holds for more subtle, implicit uncertainty expressions (e.g. "maybe", "might") during different consultation phases, and assessed their relation to patient pre-post consultation anxiety. Methods: We quantified implicit markers of uncertainty of 18 GPs in 82 consultations about MUS or MES during different consultation phases. Relative frequencies of implicit uncertainty per consultation were regressed on differences in momentary anxiety pre and post consultation. Results: We coded 2590 GP utterances. Uncertainty expressions were more frequent in MUS versus MES consultations (OR = 1.54, p =.004), especially during diagnosis and treatment recommendations compared to physical examinations (OR =0.45, p =.001). Implicit uncertainty was not related to patients' changes in anxiety (b = -0.11, p =.817). Conclusions: GPs express more uncertainty during MUS (versus MES) consultations, especially during the diagnostic phase and treatment recommendations. This does not necessarily affect patient anxiety. Practice implications: Implicit uncertainty expressions reflect the mere complexity of communicating a medically unexplained diagnosis, which does not affect patient anxiety. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Presently 43 languages have been identified as belonging to this category, for instance, English, Spanish, German, Bengali, Hindi and Urdu. This article forms an introduction to the special issue "Pluricentric Languages in Speech Science and Technology"by giving an overview of current challenges with respect to the development of speech and language resources, annotation and analysis tools, as well as speech technology services for pluricentric languages. The article discusses potential solutions that come from cross-fertilization: on the one hand, how phonetic and linguistic knowledge may contribute to advancements in speech technology, and on the other, how speech technology may facilitate phonetic and linguistic studies on pluricentric languages. In our discussion, we include the research methods and findings of the eight research articles of this special issue and point towards promising paths for future research in the field.

A Dutch Pediatric Cohort Study	FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS			English	Article						child; respiratory symptom; season; age; cohort; general population	1ST YEAR; OTITIS-MEDIA; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; TRACT INFECTIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ILLNESS; DETERMINANTS; PREVALENCE; BURDEN; LIFE	Aim: To study the pattern of respiratory symptoms in children in the general population. Method: We followed a cohort of children for up to 2 years through parents completing weekly online questionnaires in the Child-Is-Ill study ("Kind-en-Ziekmeting" in Dutch); the study was running 2012-2015. Inclusion criteria were "an ordinary child" (according to the parents) and <18 years old at inclusion. We especially encouraged participation of post-infancy children. Age at inclusion, sex, smoking exposure, allergy in the family, and frequent infections in the family were noted. Pearson's correlation, principal component analysis, latent class analysis, latent profile analysis, linear regression, and linear mixed effects regression were used in the statistical analyses. Results: Data were collected on 55,524 childweeks in 755 children (50% girls; median age, 7 years; interquartile range, 4-11 years, 97% >= 2 years at inclusion), with reported symptom(s) in 8,425 childweeks (15%), leading to school absenteeism in 25%, doctor's visits in 12%, and parental sick leave in 8%; symptoms lasting >= 3 weeks were rare (2% of episodes). Linear mixed effects regression showed significant, but only limited, effects of season on the proportion of "symptom(s) reported" per individual child. Only runny nose showed a significant, but very small, age effect. However, the variability between the children was considerable. There were no obvious subgroups of children with specific symptom combinations. Conclusion: In any randomly chosen week, the vast majority of children (85%) in our-mainly-post-infancy cohort derived from the general population did not have any symptom, even in the younger age group, even in winter. The children showed considerable variability; no clear subgroups of symptom patterns could be identified, underlining the difficult position of healthcare providers. These results support our opinion that post-infancy children in the general population should not be evaluated as if they are infants when they have recurrent respiratory symptoms. If they clearly deviate from the above-described most common pattern, it is wise to keep an eye on potential, maybe even rare, serious underlying causes.

J.; van Dulmen, Sandra; Das, Enny			Gender stereotyping in medical interaction: A Membership Categorization Analysis	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article						Patient-provider interaction; Health communication; Gender; Stereotypes	UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS; CONVERSATION	Objective: Gender can be a valuable resource in communication but also a problem, perpetuating gender ste-reotypes. So far, there has been little attention for how healthcare professionals and patients make gender relevant in medical interactions. The approach of Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) is particularly pertinent to meticulously analyze gender in medical communication. Applying MCA, this study analyzes how activity descriptions implicitly associated with gender stereotypes, e.g., "carrying a laundry basket up the stairs", feature in the course of GPs' explanations of a question or diagnosis. The aim is to provide a new perspective on the relationship between gender and medical interaction, and to increase our understanding of how gender stereotypes are reproduced in the medical setting.Method: Two cases of GPs using gendered explanations in Dutch general practice interactions are analyzed turn -by-turn using MCA. Results: The findings show how GPs' descriptions of gendered activities serve the exemplification of technical terms, designed for the specific patient, while also casting the patient in a traditional gender role.Conclusion: Invoking gender in medical interaction may serve a communicative goal while also perpetuating stereotypes. Practice implications: Insight in the subtleties of gender construction in medical interactions could enhance gender awareness and sensitivity in healthcare.

A Longitudinal Field Experiment	HEALTH COMMUNICATION			English	Article								Dental caries is the most common chronic condition among children, it is thus a necessity to develop health communication tools to increase children's dental hygiene. Prior research among adults indicates that entertaining narrative communication can promote health behaviors, but knowledge on narrative effects on children's health outcomes is limited. In a repeated measures field experiment (N = 94, 4-10 years) we examined the long-term effects of repeated exposure to a humorous tooth brushing narrative about an orange monkey, versus an expository text on dental care, on children's self-reported and biomedical dental hygiene (plaque scores). We also explored narrative, affective and cognitive processes. Findings showed that the humorous narrative increased character engagement, enjoyment, and moral judgment compared with the expository condition. Enjoyment and moral judgment, in turn, predicted increases and decreases in plaque scores, respectively. We conclude that effectiveness of humorous narrative approach crucially depends on whether the child understands it when a story character is violating the rule.

We recorded eye movements and speech while college students (N = 32) orally read identical texts that we categorized and formatted as either literary prose or poetry. We further varied the text position of critical regions (text-initial vs. text-medial) to compare how identical information is read and articulated with and without context; this allowed us to assess whether genre-specific reading strategies make differential use of identical context information. We observed genre-dependent differences in reading and speaking tempo that reflected several aspects of reading and articulation. Analyses of regions of interests revealed that word-skipping increased particularly while readers progressed through the texts in the prose condition; speech rhythm was more pronounced in the poetry condition irrespective of the text position. Our results characterize strategic poetry and prose reading, indicate that adjustments of reading behavior partly reflect differences in phonetic surface form, and shed light onto the dynamics of genre-specific literary reading. They generally support a theory of literary comprehension that assumes distinct literary processing modes and incorporates text categorization as an initial processing step.

The present study sheds new light on this debate with a multimodal analysis of individual sound and melody descriptions obtained in an interactive communication paradigm with speakers of Dutch and Farsi. The findings reveal that, in contrast to Dutch speakers, Farsi speakers do not use a height-pitch metaphor consistently in speech. Both Dutch and Farsi speakers' co-speech gestures did reveal a mapping of higher pitches to higher space and lower pitches to lower space, and this gesture space-pitch mapping tended to co-occur with corresponding spatial words (high-low). However, this mapping was much weaker in Farsi speakers than Dutch speakers. This suggests that cross-linguistic differences shape the conceptualization of pitch and further calls into question the universality of height-pitch associations.

This may have consequences for the encoding of events and its subsequent multimodal language production-an issue that has received relatively little attention to date. In this study, we compared motion events presented as audio-only, visual-only, or multimodal (visual + audio) input and measured speech and co-speech gesture depicting path and manner of motion in Turkish. Input modality affected speech production. Speakers with audio-only input produced more path descriptions and fewer manner descriptions in speech compared to speakers who received visual input. In contrast, the type and frequency of gestures did not change across conditions. Path-only gestures dominated throughout. Our results suggest that while speech is more susceptible to auditory vs. visual input in encoding aspects of motion events, gesture is less sensitive to such differences.

Different coding systems have been developed to unravel the interaction. Most schemes consist of predefined categories that quantify the content of communication (the what). Though the form (the how) of the interaction is equally important, protocols that systematically code variations in form are lacking. Patterns of form and how they may differ between groups therefore remain unnoticed. To fill this gap, we present CLECI, Coding Linguistic Elements in Clinical Interactions, a protocol for the development of a quantitative codebook analyzing communication form in medical interactions. Methods Analyzing with a CLECI codebook is a four-step process, i.e. preparation, codebook development, (double-)coding, and analysis and report. Core activities within these phases are research question formulation, data collection, selection of utterances, iterative deductive and inductive category refinement, reliability testing, coding, analysis, and reporting. Results and conclusion We present step-by-step instructions for a CLECI analysis and illustrate this process in a case study. We highlight theoretical and practical issues as well as the iterative codebook development which combines theory-based and data-driven coding. Theory-based codes assess how relevant linguistic elements occur in natural interactions, whereas codes derived from the data accommodate linguistic elements to real-life interactions and contribute to theory-building. This combined approach increases research validity, enhances theory, and adjusts to fit naturally occurring data. CLECI will facilitate the study of communication form in clinical interactions and other institutional settings.

The quantification of gesture-speech synchrony: A tutorial and validation of multimodal data acquisition using device-based and video-based motion tracking	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Motion tracking; Video recording; Deep learning; Gesture and speech analysis; Multimodal language	COORDINATION; MOVEMENT	There is increasing evidence that hand gestures and speech synchronize their activity on multiple dimensions and timescales. For example, gesture's kinematic peaks (e.g., maximum speed) are coupled with prosodic markers in speech. Such coupling operates on very short timescales at the level of syllables (200 ms), and therefore requires high-resolution measurement of gesture kinematics and speech acoustics. High-resolution speech analysis is common for gesture studies, given that field's classic ties with (psycho)linguistics. However, the field has lagged behind in the objective study of gesture kinematics (e.g., as compared to research on instrumental action). Often kinematic peaks in gesture are measured by eye, where a "moment of maximum effort" is determined by several raters. In the present article, we provide a tutorial on more efficient methods to quantify the temporal properties of gesture kinematics, in which we focus on common challenges and possible solutions that come with the complexities of studying multimodal language. We further introduce and compare, using an actual gesture dataset (392 gesture events), the performance of two video-based motion-tracking methods (deep learning vs. pixel change) against a high-performance wired motion-tracking system (Polhemus Liberty). We show that the videography methods perform well in the temporal estimation of kinematic peaks, and thus provide a cheap alternative to expensive motion-tracking systems. We hope that the present article incites gesture researchers to embark on the widespread objective study of gesture kinematics and their relation to speech.

Yet these interactional resources have rarely been studied together, so little is known about if and how people combine multiple modalities in alignment to achieve joint reference. To investigate this, we systematically track the emergence of lexical and gestural alignment in a referential communication task with novel objects. Quantitative analyses reveal that people frequently use a combination of lexical and gestural alignment, and that such multimodal alignment tends to emerge earlier compared to unimodal alignment. Qualitative analyses of the interactional contexts in which alignment emerges reveal how people flexibly deploy lexical and gestural alignment in line with modality affordances and communicative needs.

Cross-language activation in bimodal bilinguals: Do mouthings affect the co-activation of speech during sign recognition?	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article						cross-language activation; bimodal bilingualism; mouthings; sign-picture verification	WORD RECOGNITION	The present study provides insight into cross-language activation in hearing bimodal bilinguals by (1) examining co-activation of spoken words during processing of signs by hearing bimodal bilingual users of Dutch (their L1) and Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT; late learners) and (2) investigating the contribution of mouthings to bimodal cross-language activation. NGT signs were presented with or without mouthings in two sign-picture verification experiments. In both experiments the phonological relation (unrelated, cohort overlap or final rhyme overlap) between the Dutch translation equivalents of the NGT signs and pictures was manipulated. Across both experiments, the results showed slower responses for sign-picture pairs with final rhyme overlap relative to phonologically unrelated sign-picture pairs, indicating co-activation of the spoken language during sign processing, but no significant effect for sign-picture pairs with cohort overlap in Dutch. In addition, co-activation was not affected by the presence or absence of mouthings.

However, other factors may contribute to similarities between languages. Inheritance from a shared ancestral language and universal preference for a linguistic property may both overshadow contact signals. How can we find geographical contact areas in language data, while accounting for the confounding effects of inheritance and universal preference? We present sBayes, an algorithm for Bayesian clustering in the presence of confounding effects. The algorithm learns which similarities are better explained by confounders, and which are due to contact effects. Contact areas are free to take any shape or size, but an explicit geographical prior ensures their spatial coherence. We test sBayes on simulated data and apply it in two case studies to reveal language contact in South America and the Balkans. Our results are supported by findings from previous studies. While we focus on detecting language contact, the method can also be used to uncover other traces of shared history in cultural evolution, and more generally, to reveal latent spatial clusters in the presence of confounders.

Two-Stage Chunking Operation in Reading	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; hierarchy; lexical access; reading; segmentation	TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; COMPOUND WORDS; MORPHOLOGICAL DECOMPOSITION; MENTAL-IMAGERY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; SPEECH; BRAIN; MODEL; MODULATION; ROUTE	Chunking in language comprehension is a process that segments continuous linguistic input into smaller chunks that are in the reader's mental lexicon. Effective chunking during reading facilitates disambiguation and enhances efficiency for comprehension. However, the chunking mechanisms remain elusive, especially in reading, given that information arrives simultaneously yet the written systems may not have explicit cues for labeling boundaries such as Chinese. What are the mechanisms of chunking that mediates the reading of the text that contains hierarchical information? We investigated this question by manipulating the lexical status of the chunks at distinct levels in four-character Chinese strings, including the two-character local chunk and four-character global chunk. Male and female human participants were asked to make lexical decisions on these strings in a behavioral experiment, followed by a passive reading task when their electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The behavioral results showed that the lexical decision time of lexicalized two-char-acter local chunks was influenced by the lexical status of the four-character global chunk, but not vice versa, which indicated the processing of global chunks possessed priority over the local chunks. The EEG results revealed that familiar lexical chunks were detected simultaneously at both levels and further processed in a different temporal order, the onset of lexical access for the global chunks was earlier than that of local chunks. These consistent results suggest a two-stage operation for chunking in reading, the simultaneous detection of familiar lexical chunks at multiple levels around 100 ms followed by recognition of chunks with global precedence.

Grammatical Gender in German Influences How Role-Nouns Are Interpreted: Evidence from ERPs	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENTENCES; REPRESENTATION; MUSICIANS; LANGUAGE; FRENCH; IMPACT	Grammatically masculine role-nouns (e.g., Studentenmasc.'students') can refer to men and women but may favor an interpretation where only men are considered the referent. If true, this has implications for a society aiming to achieve equal representation in the workplace since, for example, job adverts use such role descriptions. To investigate the interpretation of role-nouns, the present ERP study assessed grammatical gender processing in German. Twenty participants read sentences where a role-noun (masculine or feminine) introduced a group of people, followed by a congruent (masculine-men, feminine-women) or incongruent (masculine-women, feminine-men) continuation. Both for feminine-men and masculine-women continuations a P600 (500 to 800 ms) was observed; another positivity was already present from 300 to 500 ms for feminine-men continuations but critically not for masculine-women continuations. The results imply a male-biased rather than gender-neutral interpretation of the masculine-despite widespread usage of the masculine as a gender-neutral form-suggesting that masculine forms are inadequate for representing genders equally.

In this paper we test this claim by seeking predictive patterns in wine reviews, which ostensibly aim to provide guides to perceptual content. Wine reviews have previously been critiqued as random and meaningless. We collected an English corpus of wine reviews with their structured metadata, and applied machine learning techniques to automatically predict the wine's color, grape variety, and country of origin. To train the three supervised classifiers, three different information sources were incorporated: lexical bag-of-words features, domain-specific terminology features, and semantic word embedding features. In addition, using regression analysis we investigated basic review properties, i.e., review length, average word length, and their relationship to the scalar values of price and review score. Our results show that wine experts do share a common vocabulary to describe wines and they use this in a consistent way, which makes it possible to automatically predict wine characteristics based on the review text alone. This means that odors and flavors may be more expressible in language than typically acknowledged.

Assessing the Salience and Greenness of Environmentally Friendly Packaging Cues	JOURNAL OF FOOD PRODUCTS MARKETING			English	Article						Product packaging; eco-labeling; mouse tracking; green consumerism; sustainability; environmental friendliness	EYE-TRACKING; MOUSE-TRACKING; CONSUMER; ATTENTION; CHOICES; DESIGN; BRAND; SUSTAINABILITY; EXPLICIT; BEHAVIOR	Environmentally friendly products become increasingly popular. To be considered for purchase, they must be (1) sufficiently salient and (2) perceived as environmentally friendly ("green"). The current paper investigates whether implicit (packaging material) and explicit (eco-labeling) packaging cues can facilitate such salience and greenness perceptions. We conducted a mixed-method, within-subjects experiment using self-report measures to assess perceived greenness, and mouse tracking as an exploratory measurement method to assess salience. Finally, we explored whether green consumerism, as a personal value, moderates these effects. Results confirm that both implicit and explicit cues that signalize environmental friendliness positively influence perceived salience and greenness. Furthermore, we find that implicit and explicit cues seem mostly independent in affecting salience and greenness perceptions and that green consumerism is no prerequisite for most of these packaging effects to emerge. As such, this research provides important new theoretical and practical insights on the role of packaging in food marketing.	[Ischen, Carolin; Meijers, Marijn H.

J.; van Hout, Roeland			The Effect of Background Noise on the Word Activation Process in Nonnative Spoken-Word Recognition	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						nonnative spoken-word recognition; noise; competitor space; proficiency; inhibition ability	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; NEIGHBORHOOD DENSITY; TIME-COURSE; LISTENERS; ENGLISH; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; COMPETITION; CONSONANTS; MODEL	This article investigates 2 questions: (1) does the presence of background noise lead to a differential increase in the number of simultaneously activated candidate words in native and nonnative listening? And (2) do individual differences in listeners' cognitive and linguistic abilities explain the differential effect of background noise on (non-) native speech recognition? English and Dutch students participated in an English word recognition experiment, in which either a word's onset or offset was masked by noise. The native listeners outperformed the nonnative listeners in all listening conditions. Importantly, however, the effect of noise on the multiple activation process was found to be remarkably similar in native and nonnative listening. The presence of noise increased the set of candidate words considered for recognition in both native and nonnative listening. The results indicate that the observed performance differences between the English and Dutch listeners should not be primarily attributed to a differential effect of noise, but rather to the difference between native and nonnative listening. Additional analyses showed that word-initial information was found to be more important than word-final information during spoken-word recognition. When word-initial information was no longer reliably available word recognition accuracy dropped and word frequency information could no longer be used suggesting that word frequency information is strongly tied to the onset of words and the earliest moments of lexical access. Proficiency and inhibition ability were found to influence nonnative spoken-word recognition in noise, with a higher proficiency in the nonnative language and worse inhibition ability leading to improved recognition performance.

A transcription-less quantitative analysis of aphasic discourse elicited with an adapted version of the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT)	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						aphasia; functional communication; transcription-less discourse analysis; ANELT	RELIABILITY	Background For speakers with mild to moderate expressive aphasia the ultimate goal of aphasia therapy is to improve verbal functional communication, which may be assessed with the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Test for Everyday Language (ANELT; Blomert et al., 1995). The ANELT is based on a qualitative and transcription-less method of analysis: the scoring is based on personal judgement and directly made from the recording of the test. Previous research (Ruiter et al., 2011) has shown that a quantitative measure for the ANELT not only allows verbal effectiveness (i.e., the amount of essential information conveyed) to be measured more sensitively, but also allows derivation of a measure of verbal efficiency (i.e., average amount of essential information produced per time unit). Although the quantitative scoring further improved the construct validity of the ANELT, there is a limitation that hinders its clinical application: the quantitative measure requires orthographic transcription of the spoken responses to the test. That is, the quantitative scoring is transcription-based. Aims In order to work towards clinical applicability of the quantitative measure of the ANELT, this study addressed the potential of a transcription-less variant of the quantitative analysis, in which the amount of essential information is directly quantified on the basis of recording, as a valid and reliable procedure for the measurement of verbal effectiveness. Methods & Procedures A total of 56 speakers of Dutch participated: 31 neurologically healthy speakers and 25 persons with aphasia. Monologic discourse elicited with 10 scenarios from an adapted version of the ANELT (Ruiter et al., 2016) was analysed with both a transcription-based quantitative method and a transcription-less quantitative one. Resulting data were systematically compared on the following psychometric properties: internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, construct validity, convergent validity, and known-group validity. Outcomes & Results Internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were good and comparable between both scoring methods. Only for one scenario did the transcription-based scoring method yield higher agreement among the raters. With respect to validity, both scoring methods seem to yield measures of the same underlying constructs, show a strong and positive correlation, and allow differentiation between persons with and without aphasia. Conclusions Although future research is needed to develop norm scores and investigate other psychometric properties, the result from the comparison demonstrated the potential of the transcription-less quantitative method as a valid and reliable method to analyse monologic discourse elicited with the adapted ANELT.

Analyses of lengthening effects showed that the two learner groups followed different developmental paths in their acquisition of accentual and final lengthening: Both groups showed transfer effects from the L1, but while the DLS systematically approached their target until attainment, the SLD showed more variability in their development. In addition, syllable structure complexity affected L2 rhythm acquisition, and to a substantially larger extent for the SLD compared to the DLS. The results support a model of L2 rhythm acquisition in which learning direction is included as a factor, and that allows for the interaction of various language-specific properties that contribute to speech rhythm, like syllable structure complexity.

However, current attempts at identifying and assessing the conversational devices that make this possible are fragmented across disciplines and investigate single devices within single contexts. We present a comprehensive conceptual framework to investigate conversational devices, their relations, and how they adjust to contextual demands. In two corpus studies, we systematically test the role of three conversational devices: backchannels, repair, and linguistic entrainment. Contrasting affiliative and task oriented conversations within participants, we find that conversational devices adaptively adjust to the increased need for precision in the latter: We show that low-precision devices such as backchannels are more frequent in affiliative conversations, whereas more costly but higher-precision mechanisms, such as specific repairs, are more frequent in task-oriented conversations. Further, task-oriented conversations involve higher complementarity of contributions in terms of the content and perspective: lower semantic entrainment and less frequent (but richer) lexical and syntactic entrainment. Finally, we show that the observed variations in the use of conversational devices are potentially adaptive: pairs of interlocutors that show stronger linguistic complementarity perform better across the two tasks. By combining motivated comparisons of several conversational contexts and theoretically informed computational analyses of empirical data the present work lays the foundations for a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding the use of conversational devices in dialogue.

Different routes to liking: how readers arrive at narrative evaluations	COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS			English	Article						Appreciation; Narratives; Reading; Bayesian multilevel modeling; Literature	AESTHETIC APPRECIATION; FICTION; MODEL; SIMULATION; PLEASURE; EXPOSURE; GENRE; PRINT	When two people read the same story, they might both end up liking it very much. However, this does not necessarily mean that their reasons for liking it were identical. We therefore ask what factors contribute to "liking" a story, and-most importantly-how people vary in this respect. We found that readers like stories because they find them interesting, amusing, suspenseful and/or beautiful. However, the degree to which these components of appreciation were related to how much readers liked stories differed between individuals. Interestingly, the individual slopes of the relationships between many of the components and liking were (positively or negatively) correlated. This indicated, for instance, that individuals displaying a relatively strong relationship between interest and liking, generally display a relatively weak relationship between sadness and liking. The individual differences in the strengths of the relationships between the components and liking were not related to individual differences in expertize, a characteristic strongly associated with aesthetic appreciation of visual art. Our work illustrates that it is important to take into consideration the fact that individuals differ in how they arrive at their evaluation of literary stories, and that it is possible to quantify these differences in empirical experiments. Our work suggests that future research should be careful about "overfitting" theories of aesthetic appreciation to an "idealized reader," but rather take into consideration variations across individuals in the reason for liking a particular story.

We thematically analysed 153 national newspaper articles about the risks posed by rubber granulate between September 2016 and February 2017. Our results suggest that newspaper coverage might have contributed to heightened public risk perceptions by presenting the negligible health risk as uncertain, focusing on controversy between authorities and experts, describing responses such as concerns, commotion, and adopted risk mitigation measures by members of the public, and by providing insufficient contextualization on whether hazardous substances in rubber granulate pose a threat to health. The risks posed by rubber granulate is one of the many modern risks that has become subject to heated and mediated public discussions. Our results provide in-depth insights into important content elements in media coverage during such discussions and the impact of these elements on public perceptions. Public health institutes and other authorities might be able to mitigate the amplification of risks through media coverage by means of appropriate preparedness and response.

This study investigates whether a feature of language coded in grammar-numeral classifiers-affects the conceptual representation of objects. We compared speakers of Mandarin (a classifier language) with speakers of Dutch (a language without classifiers) on how they judged object similarity in 4 studies. In the first 3 studies, participants had to rate how similar a target object was to 4 comparison objects. 1 of which shared a classifier with the target. Objects were presented as either words or pictures. Overall, the target object was always rated as most similar to the object with the shared classifier, but this was the case regardless of the language of the participant. In a final study using a successive pile-sorting task, we also found that the underlying object concepts were similar for speakers of Mandarin and Dutch. Speakers of a nonclassifier language are therefore sensitive to the same conceptual similarities that underlie classifier systems in a classifier language. Classifier systems may therefore reflect conceptual structure, rather than shape it.

In theory, such procedures all measure the same underlying speech perception and learning mechanisms and the choice between them should ideally be irrelevant in unveiling infant preference. However, the ManyBabies study (ManyBabies Consortium, 2019), a cross-laboratory collaboration on infants' preference for child-directed speech, revealed that choice of procedure can modulate effect sizes. Here we examined whether procedure also modulates preference in paradigms that add a learning phase prior to test: a speech segmentation paradigm. Such paradigms are particularly important for studying the learning mechanisms infants can employ for language acquisition. We carried out the same familiarization-then-test experiment with the three different procedures (32 unique infants per procedure). Procedures were compared on various factors, such as overall effect, average looking time and drop-out rate. The key observations are that the HPP yielded a larger familiarity preference, but also reported larger drop-out rates. This raises questions about the generalizability of results. We argue that more collaborative research into different procedures in infant preference experiments is required in order to interpret the variation in infant preferences more accurately.

Previous work suggests that infants process linguistic-phonetic information from simplified sung melodies. The present study investigated whether infants learn words from ecologically valid children's songs. Testing 40 Dutch-learning 10-month-olds in a familiarization-then-test electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, this study asked whether infants can segment repeated target words embedded in songs during familiarization and subsequently recognize those words in continuous speech in the test phase. To replicate previous speech work and compare segmentation across modalities, infants participated in both song and speech sessions. Results showed a positive event-related potential (ERP) familiarity effect to the final compared to the first target occurrences during both song and speech familiarization. No evidence was found for word recognition in the test phase following either song or speech. Comparisons across the stimuli of the present and a comparable previous study suggested that acoustic prominence and speech rate may have contributed to the polarity of the ERP familiarity effect and its absence in the test phase. Overall, the present study provides evidence that 10-month-old infants can segment words embedded in songs, and it raises questions about the acoustic and other factors that enable or hinder infant word segmentation from songs and speech.

Using conversation analysis to explore feedback on resident performance	ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article						Postgraduate medical education; Feedback on resident's performance; Conversation analysis; Program director; Resident	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; PERCEPTIONS; REFLECTION; SURGEONS	Feedback on clinical performance of residents is seen as a fundamental element in postgraduate medical education. Although literature on feedback in medical education is abundant, many supervisors struggle with providing this feedback and residents experience feedback as insufficiently constructive. With a detailed analysis of real-world feedback conversations, this study aims to contribute to the current literature by deepening the understanding of how feedback on residents' performance is provided, and to formulate recommendations for improvement of feedback practice. Eight evaluation meetings between program directors and residents were recorded in 2015-2016. These meetings were analyzed using conversation analysis. This is an ethno-methodological approach that uses a data-driven, iterative procedure to uncover interactional patterns that structure naturally occurring, spoken interaction. Feedback in our data took two forms: feedback as a unidirectional activity and feedback as a dialogic activity. The unidirectional feedback activities prevailed over the dialogic activities. The two different formats elicit different types of resident responses and have different implications for the progress of the interaction. Both feedback formats concerned positive as well as negative feedback and both were often mitigated by the participants. Unidirectional feedback and mitigating or downplaying feedback is at odds with the aim of feedback in medical education. Dialogic feedback avoids the pitfall of a program director-dominated conversation and gives residents the opportunity to take ownership of their strengths and weaknesses, which increases chances to change resident behavior. On the basis of linguistic analysis of our real-life data we suggest implications for feedback conversations.

DMIP: A Method for Identifying Potentially Deliberate Metaphor in Language Use	CORPUS PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Deliberate metaphor; Deliberate Metaphor Theory; Identification procedure; Discourse; Corpus analysis	CONVENTIONAL METAPHOR; MODEL	This paper introduces the Deliberate Metaphor Identification Procedure (DMIP), a method for the systematic and reliable identification of potentially deliberate metaphor in language use. We take a semiotic approach to deliberate metaphor, and propose that, on a semiotic level, the distinction between potentially deliberate and non-deliberate metaphor hinges on the question whether the source domain functions as a distinct referent in the meaning of a metaphorical utterance. We present DMIP and illustrate the procedure in practice on the basis of the analysis of a series of real-world examples. We also report on inter-rater reliability testing. Finally, we discuss the implications of adopting DMIP as a tool for deliberate-metaphor analysis, and point out how this approach can contribute to the further development of Deliberate Metaphor Theory.

This means that pregnant women who are contemplating NIPS can receive counseling from their midwife or obstetrician. The aim of this study is to understand the communicative practices and decision-making principles regarding first-tier use of NIPS, as experienced by Dutch midwives. Methods: Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with Dutch midwives (n = 10) exploring their conversations about NIPS counseling and decision making. Results: Midwives value the autonomy of women in decisions on NIPS. They consider it a midwifery task to assess women's awareness of the risks and implications of using or not using this mode of screening. The optimal level of awareness may differ between women and midwives, creating novel challenges for informed decision making in midwifery communication. Key conclusions and implications for practice: Negotiating awareness about NIPS in individual women is a relatively new and complex midwifery task in need of counseling time and skill. NIPS practices call for a reflection on midwifery values in the context of integrated maternity care.

Metaphor in communication: the distribution of potentially deliberate metaphor across register and word class	CORPORA			English	Article						deliberate metaphor; Deliberate Metaphor Theory; metaphor identification; register; word class	HEADLINES; MEANINGS; MIP	There is renewed interest in the special role that metaphor can have in its communicative status as metaphor between language users. This paper investigates the occurrence of such deliberate metaphors in comparison with non-deliberate metaphors. To this end, a corpus of 24,762 metaphors was analysed for the presence of potentially deliberate (versus non-deliberate) metaphor use across registers and word classes. Results show that 4.36 percent of metaphors in the corpus are identified as potentially deliberate metaphors. News and fiction contain significantly more potentially deliberate metaphors, while academic texts and conversations exhibit significantly fewer potentially deliberate metaphors than expected. Moreover, nouns and adjectives are used relatively more frequently as potentially deliberate metaphors, while adverbs, verbs and prepositions are used relatively less frequently as potentially deliberate metaphors. These results can be explained by referring to the overall communicative properties of the registers concerned, as well as to the role of the different word classes in those registers.

Processing language in face-to-face conversation: Questions with gestures get faster responses	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Article						Multimodal communication; Gesture; Language processing; Turn-taking	TURN-TAKING; ICONIC GESTURES; SPEECH; BODY; COMPREHENSION; ORGANIZATION; SIGNATURES; INTERACT	The home of human language use is face-to-face interaction, a context in which communicative exchanges are characterised not only by bodily signals accompanying what is being said but also by a pattern of alternating turns at talk. This transition between turns is astonishingly fast-typically a mere 200-ms elapse between a current and a next speaker's contribution-meaning that comprehending, producing, and coordinating conversational contributions in time is a significant challenge. This begs the question of whether the additional information carried by bodily signals facilitates or hinders language processing in this time-pressured environment. We present analyses of multimodal conversations revealing that bodily signals appear to profoundly influence language processing in interaction: Questions accompanied by gestures lead to shorter turn transition times-that is, to faster responses-than questions without gestures, and responses come earlier when gestures end before compared to after the question turn has ended. These findings hold even after taking into account prosodic patterns and other visual signals, such as gaze. The empirical findings presented here provide a first glimpse of the role of the body in the psycholinguistic processes underpinning human communication.

In this article, we focus on South American pronouns, as a potential example of items with their own history passing between the boundaries of language families, what has been dubbed in the literature as 'historical markers'. Historical markers are not a direct diagnostic of genealogical relatedness among languages, but account for phenomena beyond the grasp of the historical comparative method. Relatedness between pronoun systems can thus serve as suggestions for closer studies of genealogical relationships. How can we use computational methods to help us with this process? We collected pronouns for 121 South American languages, grouped them into classes and aligned the phonemes within each class (assisted by automatic methods). We then used Bayesian phylogenetic tree inference to model the birth and death of individual phonemes within cognate sets, rather than the typical practice of modelling whole cognate sets. The reliability of the splits found in our analysis was low above the level of language family, and validation on alternative data suggested that the analysis cannot be used to infer general genealogical relatedness among languages. However, many results aligned with existing theories, and the analysis as a whole provided a useful starting point for future analyses of historical relationships between the languages of South America. We show that using automated methods with evolutionary principles can support progress in historical linguistics research.

J	Speed, LJ; Papies, EK; Majid, A				Speed, Laura J.; Papies, Esther K.; Majid, Asifa			Mental Simulation Across Sensory Modalities Predicts Attractiveness of Food Concepts	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED			English	Article						sensory language; food; conceptual representation; sensorimotor norms; mental simulation	ELABORATED INTRUSION THEORY; EXCLUSIVITY NORMS; TASTY INTUITION; LANGUAGE; IMAGERY; WORDS; MOTOR; ODOR; FLEXIBILITY; EMBODIMENT	Concepts are grounded in mental simulation of sensory information, but the exact role it plays in everyday cognition is unknown. Here, we investigate its role in an important conceptual domain relevant for everyday behavior-food. We conducted two preregistered studies to test whether multimodal mental simulation is linked to attractiveness of food concepts. In Study 1, using the Lancaster Sensorimotor norms for a variety of concepts, we found unhealthy food concepts are more strongly associated with gustation, olfaction, and interoception than healthy food concepts. Importantly, these associations mediated the relationship between food healthiness and food attractiveness. In Study 2, we collected new sensory ratings with food words only and found unhealthy food concepts were more strongly associated with all perceptual modalities than healthy food concepts. Again, these associations mediated the relationship between healthiness and attractiveness. The mediating role of sensory associations to food attractiveness was also affected by context. Specifically, when participants thought about food in an eating context cued by verbal instruction, mediation by perceptual strength was weaker. Overall, we find multimodal sensory experience underlies people's belief that unhealthy food is more attractive than healthy food. This suggests mental simulation has an important role in goal-directed behavior.

The Case of Negation in Kata Kolok	LANGUAGES			English	Article						Kata Kolok; negation; grammaticalization; language emergence; language change; non-manuals; gesture	SIGN-LANGUAGE; RECESSIVE DEAFNESS; GESTURES; TYPOLOGY; IMITATION; TIME	Typological comparisons have revealed that signers can use manual elements and/or a non-manual marker to express standard negation, but little is known about how such systematic marking emerges from its gestural counterparts as a new sign language arises. We analyzed 1.73 h of spontaneous language data, featuring six deaf native signers from generations III-V of the sign language isolate Kata Kolok (Bali). These data show that Kata Kolok cannot be classified as a manual dominant or non-manual dominant sign language since both the manual negative sign and a side-to-side headshake are used extensively. Moreover, the intergenerational comparisons indicate a considerable increase in the use of headshake spreading for generation V which is unlikely to have resulted from contact with Indonesian Sign Language varieties. We also attest a specialized negative existential marker, namely, tongue protrusion, which does not appear in co-speech gesture in the surrounding community. We conclude that Kata Kolok is uniquely placed in the typological landscape of sign language negation, and that grammaticalization theory is essential to a deeper understanding of the emergence of grammatical structure from gesture.

Bimodal bilingual education creates a supportive environment that stimulates deaf children's learning through the use of sign language. However, it is still unclear how exposure to sign language might contribute to improving reading ability. Here, we investigate the relative contribution of several cognitive and linguistic variables to the development of word and text reading fluency in deaf children in bimodal bilingual education programmes. The participants of this study were 62 school-aged (8 to 10 years old at the start of the 3-year study) deaf children who took part in bilingual education (using Dutch and Sign Language of The Netherlands) and 40 age-matched hearing children. We assessed vocabulary knowledge in speech and sign, phonological awareness in speech and sign, receptive fingerspelling ability, and short-term memory at time 1 (T1). At times 2 (T2) and 3 (T3), we assessed word and text reading fluency. We found that (1) speech-based vocabulary strongly predicted word and text reading at T2 and T3, (2) fingerspelling ability was a strong predictor of word and text reading fluency at T2 and T3, (3) speech-based phonological awareness predicted word reading accuracy at T2 and T3 but did not predict text reading fluency, and (4) fingerspelling and STM predicted word reading latency at T2 while sign-based phonological awareness predicted this outcome measure at T3. These results suggest that fingerspelling may have an important function in facilitating the construction of orthographical/phonological representations of printed words for deaf children and strengthening word decoding and recognition abilities.

The semantic information conveyed by iconic gestures (e.g., a drinking gesture) can aid speech comprehension in adverse listening conditions. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we investigated the spatiotemporal neural oscillatory activity associated with gestural enhancement of degraded speech comprehension. Participants watched videos of an actress uttering clear or degraded speech, accompanied by a gesture or not and completed a cued-recall task after watching every video. When gestures semantically disambiguated degraded speech comprehension, an alpha and beta power suppression and a gamma power increase revealed engagement and active processing in the hand-area of the motor cortex, the extended language network (LIFG/pSTS/STG/MTG), medial temporal lobe, and occipital regions. These observed low- and high-frequency oscillatory modulations in these areas support general unification, integration and lexical access processes during online language comprehension, and simulation of and increased visual attention to manual gestures over time. All individual oscillatory power modulations associated with gestural enhancement of degraded speech comprehension predicted a listener's correct disambiguation of the degraded verb after watching the videos. Our results thus go beyond the previously proposed role of oscillatory dynamics in unimodal degraded speech comprehension and provide first evidence for the role of low- and high-frequency oscillations in predicting the integration of auditory and visual information at a semantic level.

Visible cues, such as semantic information conveyed by iconic gestures, can enhance language comprehension in such situations. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we investigated whether spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics can predict a listener's benefit of iconic gestures during language comprehension in both internally (non-native versus native listeners) and externally (clear/degraded speech) induced adverse listening conditions. Proficient non-native speakers of Dutch were presented with videos in which an actress uttered a degraded or clear verb, accompanied by a gesture or not, and completed a cued-recall task after every video. The behavioral and oscillatory results obtained from non-native listeners were compared to an MEG study where we presented the same stimuli to native listeners (Drijvers et al., 2018a). Non-native listeners demonstrated a similar gestural enhancement effect as native listeners, but overall scored significantly slower on the cued-recall task. In both native and non-native listeners, an alpha/beta power suppression revealed engagement of the extended language network, motor and visual regions during gestural enhancement of degraded speech comprehension, suggesting similar core processes that support unification and lexical access processes. An individual's alpha/beta power modulation predicted the gestural benefit a listener experienced during degraded speech comprehension. Importantly, however, non-native listeners showed less engagement of the mouth area of the primary somatosensory cortex, left insula (beta), LIFG and ATL (alpha) than native listeners, which suggests that non-native listeners might be hindered in processing the degraded phonological cues and coupling them to the semantic information conveyed by the gesture. Native and non-native listeners thus demonstrated similar yet distinct spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics when recruiting visual cues to disambiguate degraded speech.

Different kinds of simulation during literary reading: Insights from a combined fMRI and eye-tracking study	CORTEX			English	Article; Early Access						Mental simulation; Literary reading; fMRI; Eye-tracking; Individual differences	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; MENTAL SIMULATION; SITUATION MODELS; BRAIN RESPONSES; R PACKAGE; ROBUST; MOVEMENTS; CONTEXT; OTHERS	Mental simulation is an important aspect of narrative reading. In a previous study, we found that gaze durations are differentially impacted by different kinds of mental simulation. Motor simulation, perceptual simulation, and mentalizing as elicited by literary short stories influenced eye movements in distinguishable ways (Mak & Willems, 2019). In the current study, we investigated the existence of a common neural locus for these different kinds of simulation. We additionally investigated whether individual differences during reading, as indexed by the eye movements, are reflected in domain-specific activations in the brain. We found a variety of brain areas activated by simulation-eliciting content, both modality-specific brain areas and a general simulation area. Individual variation in percent signal change in activated areas was related to measures of story appreciation as well as personal characteristics (i.e., transportability, perspective taking). Taken together, these findings suggest that mental simulation is supported by both domain-specific processes grounded in previous experiences, and by the neural mechanisms that underlie higher -order language processing (e.g., situation model building, event indexing, integration).

Yet, this challenge was absent for signing-children, possibly due to iconicity in the visual-spatial modality of expression. We investigate whether there is also a modality advantage when speaking-children's co-speech gestures are considered. Eight-year-old child and adult hearing monolingual Turkish speakers and deaf signers of Turkish-Sign-Language described pictures of objects in various spatial relations. Descriptions were coded for informativeness in speech, sign, and speech-gesture combinations for encoding Left-Right relations. The use of co-speech gestures increased the informativeness of speakers' spatial expressions compared to speech-only. This pattern was more prominent for children than adults. However, signing-adults and children were more informative than child and adult speakers even when co-speech gestures were considered. Thus, both speaking- and signing-children benefit from iconic expressions in visual modality. Finally, in each modality, children were less informative than adults, pointing to the challenge of this spatial domain in development.

Here, we further investigate the extent of this relationship in signing deaf children and adults and ask if late sign language exposure, as well as the frequency and the type of spatial language use that might be affected by late exposure, modulate subsequent memory for spatial relations. To do so, we compared spatial language and memory of 8-year-old late-signing children (after 2 years of exposure to a sign language at the school for the deaf) and late-signing adults to their native-signing counterparts. We elicited picture descriptions of Left-Right relations in Turkish Sign Language (Turk Isaret Dili) and measured the subsequent recognition memory accuracy of the described pictures. Results showed that late-signing adults and children were similar to their native-signing counterparts in how often they encoded the spatial relation. However, late-signing adults but not children differed from their native-signing counterparts in the type of spatial language they used. However, neither late sign language exposure nor the frequency and type of spatial language use modulated spatial memory accuracy. Therefore, even though late language exposure seems to influence the type of spatial language use, this does not predict subsequent memory for spatial relations. We discuss the implications of these findings based on the theories concerning the correspondence between spatial language and cognition as related or rather independent systems.

Much research has been done to investigate the conditions under which they work best. This research, however, has been mostly retrospective and has had little consideration for the actual workings of MDMs. The aim of this study was to determine how Multidisciplinary Teams (MDTs) come to a shared decision and thus how they organize MDMs moment by moment. For this purpose we recorded twenty MDMs at the Department of Emergency Medicine (ED) of the Radboud University Medical Center in The Netherlands between November 2017 and June 2018. These meetings, contrary to those discussed in the literature, were scheduled ad-hoc as patients were seen at the ED and were conducted by small MDTs of between three and six participants, always involving a surgeon, a geriatrician, and an emergency physician. Using Conversation Analysis we found that despite the ad hoc nature of these meetings, teams collaboratively developed a structure that was grounded in everyday medical practice and reached a decision in on average slightly over 10 min. First they do a case presentation in which they share the patient's medical history and results of the physical examination and any medical tests. They subsequently agree on a differential diagnosis, and then develop a work plan. Finally, the decision is often formulated to invite confirmation and make it an interactionally shared decision. The benefit of having an MDM was evidenced by discussion of patients' frailty in particular: it was sometimes omitted during the case presentation, but then consistently requested by the geriatrician. And as we show, it was occasionally invoked as a definitive argument for deciding between surgical or conservative treatment. Our analysis suggests that MDMs can have added value in other disciplines where it is feasible to schedule meetings ad hoc.

In this paper, the interplay between these principles is revealed by means of a conversation analytic study into student-initiated student-teacher interactions during desk work in Dutch secondary schools. It is investigated from a participants' perspective how teachers depart from the mundane interactional constraints imposed by students' requests for assistance. The analysis shows that there are several ways teachers depart from these constraints and that teacher and students do not necessarily show an orientation to this departure as being problematic. Rather, the departure can be related to considerations concerning the pedagogical nature of these interactions. By studying the interactional departures from mundane principles, more insight is provided in the organization of classroom interactions that are started by students' requests for assistance.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

This can make "he's" and "he was" homophonous, realized for example as [iz]. Similarly, "you're" and "you were" can both be realized as [j(sic)], etc. We investigated what types of information native listeners use to perceive such verb tenses. Possible types included acoustic cues in the phrase (e.g., in "he was"), the rate of the surrounding speech, and syntactic and semantic information in the utterance, such as the presence of time adverbs such as "yesterday" or other tensed verbs. We extracted utterances such as "So they're gonna have like a random roommate" and "And he was like, 'What's wrong?!'" from recordings of spontaneous conversations. We presented parts of these utterances to listeners, in either a written or auditory modality, to determine which types of information facilitated listeners' comprehension. Listeners rely primarily on acoustic cues in or near the target words rather than meaning and syntactic information in the context. While that information also improves comprehension in some conditions, the acoustic cues in the target itself are strong enough to reverse the percept that listeners gain from all other information together. Acoustic cues override other information in comprehending reduced productions in conversational speech.

We adopt an integrated approach to subjectivity and analyze the subjectivity profile of a causal construction in terms of three features: the propositional attitude of the consequent, the identity of the subject of consciousness (SoC), and the linguistic realization of the SoC. The investigation is based on natural discourse produced in fundamentally distinctive channels, namely, spontaneous conversation, microblogging, and formal writing. Compared to previous studies, the empirical foundation is therefore enlarged and more varied. The results show that these connectives differ systematically from each other with regard to the above three features, and that the differences remain robust across the three discourse types. The relative importance of each feature in characterizing the connectives is also determined. The propositional attitude appears to be the most important subjectivity feature, followed by the linguistic realization of the SoC and the identity of the SoC.

This phenomenon is known as the missing-VP effect. German and Dutch speakers do not experience the missing-VP effect when reading their native language, but they do when reading English as a second language (L2). We investigate whether the missing-VP effect when reading L2 English occurs in native Dutch speakers because their knowledge of English is similar to that of native English speakers (the high exposure account), or because of the difficulty of L2 reading (the low proficiency account). In an eye-tracking study, we compare the size of the missing-VP effect between native Dutch and native English participants, and across native Dutch participants with varying L2 English proficiency and exposure. Results provide evidence for both accounts, suggesting that both native-like knowledge of English and L2 reading difficulty play a role.

Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that the higher frequency of visual words in a large variety of English corpora is reflected in greater lexical differentiation-a greater number of unique words-for the visual domain in the English lexicon. In comparison, sensory modalities that are less frequently talked about, particularly taste and smell, show less lexical differentiation. In addition, we show that even though sensory language can be expected to change across historical time and between contexts of use (e.g., spoken language versus fiction), the pattern of visual dominance is a stable property of the English language. Thus, we show that across the board, precisely those semantic domains that are more frequently talked about are also more lexically differentiated, for perceptual experiences. This correlation between type and token frequencies suggests that the sensory lexicon of English is geared towards communicative efficiency.

These non-native variants ('accents') can have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for learners. Many factors have been found to contribute to a learners' proficiency in the new language. Here we examine a factor that is outside of the control of the learner, linguistic similarities between the learner's native language (L1) and the new language (Ln). We analyze the (open access) speaking proficiencies of about 50,000 Ln learners of Dutch with 62 diverse L1s. We find that a learner's L1 accounts for 9-22% of the variance in Ln speaking proficiency. This corresponds to 28-69% of the variance explained by a model with controls for other factors known to affect language learning, such as education, age of acquisition and length of exposure. We also find that almost 80% of the effect of L1 can be explained by combining measures of phonological, morphological, and lexical similarity between the L1 and the Ln. These results highlight the constraints that a learner's native language imposes on language learning, and inform theories of L1-to-Ln transfer during Ln learning and use. As predicted by some proposals, we also find that L1-Ln phonological similarity is better captured when subcategorical properties (phonological features) are considered in the calculation of phonological similarities.

We directly test whether smell is necessary for comprehension of odor language, by comparing language processing in a group of participants with no sense of smell (anosmics) to a group of control participants. We found no evidence for a difference in online comprehension of odor and taste language between anosmics and controls using a lexical decision task and a semantic similarity judgment task, suggesting olfaction is not critical to the comprehension of odor language. Contrary to predictions, anosmics were better at remembering odor words, and rated odor and taste words as more positively valenced than control participants. This study finds no detriment to odor language after losing the sense of smell, supporting the proposal that odor language is not grounded in odor perception.

In this paper, we ask whether entities such as the knife are also represented in terms of such a category (often labeled "Instrument") and, if so, whether this category has a prototype structure. We hypothesized the Proto-instrument is a tool: a physical object manipulated by an intentional agent to affect a change in another individual or object. To test this, we asked speakers of English, Dutch, and German to complete an event description task and a sentence acceptability judgment task in which events were viewed with more or less prototypical instruments. We found broad similarities in how English, Dutch, and German partition the semantic space of instrumental events, suggesting there is a shared concept of the Instrument category. However, there was no evidence to support the specific hypothesis that tools are the core of the Instrument category-instead, our results suggest the most prototypical Instrument is the direct extension of an intentional agent. This paper supports theoretical frameworks where thematic roles are analyzed in terms of prototypes and suggests new avenues of research on how instrumental category structure differs across linguistic and conceptual domains.

Gudrun; Burgers, Christian			MSDIP: A Method for Coding Source Domains in Metaphor Analysis	METAPHOR AND SYMBOL			English	Article							CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR; IDENTIFICATION; HYPERBOLE; MEANINGS; WORDS; WAR; MIP	This article describes the Metaphorical Source Domain Identification Procedure (MSDIP), which can be used to code source domains in metaphor identification. In the first part of the article, we describe the complexity of source-domain coding in corpus analysis. We argue that, in many cases, discourse is underspecified and multiple source-domain candidates may be relevant for a specific metaphorical expression. For instance, if a word like "fight" or "target" is used metaphorically, it could refer to either the source domain of war or sports. To make these issues explicit for analysts, we developed MSDIP, which builds on and extends the Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universiteit (MIPVU). In the second part of the article, we explain the coding steps of MSDIP and subsequently report on a reliability analysis, demonstrating the reproducibility of the procedure. We end with a number of detailed sample analyses, demonstrating the role of co-text and context in selecting the likeliest source-domain candidate through MSDIP. These analyses show that MSDIP is both reliable and flexible in dealing with the complexities of real-life discourse during source-domain coding.	[Reijnierse, W.

Numerous studies demonstrate consistent odor-color associations, as well as effects of color on odor perception and language. Yet, we know little about how these associations arise. Here, we test whether language is a possible mediator of odor-color associations, specifically whether odor-color associations are mediated by implicit odor naming. In two experiments, we used an interference paradigm to prevent the verbalization of odors during an odor-color matching task. If participants generate color associations subsequent to labeling an odor, interfering with verbalization during the task should affect the ability to make color associations. In Experiment 1, contrary to our hypothesis, verbal interference did not affect odor-color matches. However, since performance accuracy on the verbal interference task was high, it is possible our task did not sufficiently disrupt verbal processing. In Experiment 2, we, therefore, used an active verbal interference task, and still found no difference across interference conditions. Odor naming accuracy, odor familiarity, and odor pleasantness, however, did predict odor-color matches. This suggests that although color associations are related to semantic factors, they are not generated by recruiting odor labels in the moment. Overall, our results do not provide evidence that language plays an online role in odor-color associations, instead, they are consistent with the claim that language may have shaped associations during development.

J	Huettig, F; Audring, J; Jackendoff, R				Huettig, Falk; Audring, Jenny; Jackendoff, Ray			A parallel architecture perspective on pre-activation and prediction in language processing	COGNITION			English	Article						Language processing; Linguistic theory; Parallel architecture; Phonology; Prediction; Psychology; Psycholinguistics; Representations; Semantics; Sentence processing	SPOKEN-WORD RECOGNITION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; CONTEXT; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; MEMORY	A recent trend in psycholinguistic research has been to posit prediction as an essential function of language processing. The present paper develops a linguistic perspective on viewing prediction in terms of pre-activation. We describe what predictions are and how they are produced. Our basic premises are that (a) no prediction can be made without knowledge to support it; and (b) it is therefore necessary to characterize the precise form of that knowledge, as revealed by a suitable theory of linguistic representations. We describe the Parallel Architecture (PA: Jackendoff, 2002; Jackendoff & Audring, 2020), which makes explicit our commitments about linguistic representations, and we develop an account of processing based on these representations. Crucial to our account is that what have been traditionally treated as derivational rules of grammar are formalized by the PA as lexical items, encoded in the same format as words. We then present a theory of prediction in these terms: linguistic input activates lexical items whose beginning (or incipit) corresponds to the input encountered so far; and prediction amounts to pre-activation of the as yet unheard parts of those lexical items (the remainder). Thus the generation of predictions is a natural byproduct of processing linguistic representations. We conclude that the PA perspective on pre-activation provides a plausible account of prediction in language processing that bridges linguistic and psycholinguistic theorizing.

Reading strategies are a promising approach to treat text-level reading comprehension deficits in PWA. Nevertheless, empirical evidence for their efficacy remains rare.AimsThe primary objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a strategy-based intervention on text-level reading comprehension in PWA. Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of two strategy-based intervention components and to explore potential moderator effects.Methods & ProceduresA protocol was published prior to data acquisition. In a repeated measures trial, 26 German participants with chronic, post-stroke aphasia participated in a waiting period without aphasia treatment (control condition) followed by a strategy-based intervention called 'Strategiebasierte Textverstandnis-Therapie bei Aphasie' (StraTexT, 14 face-to-face-sessions, twice per week, 60 min each). Two strategy combinations, Intervention Micro targeting microstructure and Intervention Macro targeting macrostructure, were applied to newspaper and magazine articles. Participants were randomly allocated to two parallel groups that received these strategy combinations in interchanged sequences. Assessments were implemented before and after each period as well as 3 and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was text-level reading comprehension measured with the total score of a German version of the Test de Comprehension de Textes (TCT-D). Secondary outcome measures addressed the self-reported perception of reading abilities, reading activities and feelings about reading (German version of the Comprehensive Assessment of Reading in Aphasia CARA reading questionnaire) as well as selected cognitive functions.Outcomes & ResultsThe per-protocol-analysis included data from 22 participants. We found significant small improvements up to 6 months post-intervention compared to pre-intervention in the TCT-D Total (d = 0.35-0.46) as well as medium to large improvements in the CARA questionnaire (d = 0.68-0.96). Up to 3 months after the intervention, treatment-induced improvements in the TCT-D Total were significantly larger than change without treatment during the control condition. There was no evidence of moderator effects. Furthermore, we found improvements in several cognitive functions.Conclusions & ImplicationsReading strategies can lead to long-term improvements in text-level reading comprehension and in self-reported reading abilities, feelings about reading and reading activities in aphasia. In regular clinical settings, it seems reasonable to implement both Intervention Micro and Intervention Macro. It remains important to investigate participant characteristics that contribute to treatment success.

This randomized study tested the effects of informing 160 first-time breast cancer patients about CRCS with and without self-affirmation on the perceived frequency and severity of cognitive symptoms at 2.5-months and 6.5-months post-chemotherapy. Pre-treatment information added to experienced side-effects at 6.5-months post-chemotherapy. Self-affirmation attenuated these effects for the perceived severity of symptoms.Background: Informing patients about chemotherapy-related cognitive symptoms (CRCS) may increase perceived cognitive symptoms. This longitudinal randomized study evaluated this Adverse Information Effect (AIE) in breast cancer patients and examined whether self-affirmation (SA) can reduce AIEs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04813965). Patients and Methods: Before (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy, 160 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were randomly allocated to receive: standard information on side-effects (control), standard information with additional information about CRCS (information), or standard and additional information with a subsequent self-affirmative text (information + SA). Online-questionnaires assessed the perceived frequency (MOS-cog) and severity (MDASI-cog) of cognitive symptoms before chemotherapy (baseline, T0), and 2.5-months (T1) and 6.5-months (T2) post-chemotherapy. Higher scores indicate less frequent, and more severe symptoms, respectively. Baseline-to-follow-up analyses using a mixed-effects modeling approach compared groups over time. Results: At T0-T2, 148, 140 and 133 patients responded, respectively (attrition rates: 8%, 5%, 5%). Frequency (ES =-0.36, P = .003) and severity (ES = 0.54, P < .001) of symptoms worsened from baseline to T1, without differences between groups. At T2, symptom frequency remained stable for informed (ES =-0.3, P = .021) and self-affirmed (ES =-0.3, P = .019) patients, but returned to baseline levels for controls. At T2, symptom severity remained increased for informed patients (ES = 0.3, P = .006), but normalized for self-affirmed patients (ES = 0.2, P = .178) and controls. Conclusion: No AIEs occurred until T2. The initial overall increase in perceived cognitive symptoms recovered at T2 for controls, but not for patients who received additional infor-mation about CRCS. Self-affirmation attenuated these longer-term AIEs for the perceived severity but not the frequency of symptoms.

Here we show this has repercussions for the structure of spoken languages. We present a new statistical universal linking speech with the evolutionarily ancient sense of touch. Words that express roughness-the primary perceptual dimension of texture-are highly likely to feature a trilled /r/, the most commonly occurring rhotic consonant. In four studies, we show the pattern to be extremely robust, being the first widespread pattern of iconicity documented not just across a large, diverse sample of the world's spoken languages, but also across numerous sensory words within languages. Our deep analysis of Indo-European languages and Proto-Indo-European roots indicates remarkable historical stability of the pattern, which appears to date back at least 6000 years.

Infants' Implicit Rhyme Perception in Child Songs and Its Relationship With Vocabulary	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						rhyme; songs; vocabulary; ERP; infant	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE; SPEECH; ORGANIZATION; AWARENESS; 9-MONTH-OLDS; MOTHERS; SOUNDS; SKILLS	Rhyme perception is an important predictor for future literacy. Assessing rhyme abilities, however, commonly requires children to make explicit rhyme judgements on single words. Here we explored whether infants already implicitly process rhymes in natural rhyming contexts (child songs) and whether this response correlates with later vocabulary size. In a passive listening ERP study, 10.5 month-old Dutch infants were exposed to rhyming and non-rhyming child songs. Two types of rhyme effects were analysed: (1) ERPs elicited by the first rhyme occurring in each song (rhyme sensitivity) and (2) ERPs elicited by rhymes repeating after the first rhyme in each song (rhyme repetition). Only for the latter a tentative negativity for rhymes from 0 to 200 ms after the onset of the rhyme word was found. This rhyme repetition effect correlated with productive vocabulary at 18 months-old, but not with any other vocabulary measure (perception at 10.5 or 18 months-old). While awaiting future replication, the study indicates precursors of phonological awareness already during infancy and with ecologically valid linguistic stimuli.

Sign language phonology has been analysed on the feature level since the 1980s, yet acquisition studies predominately examine handshape, location, and movement. This study is the first to analyse the acquisition of phonology in the sign language of a Balinese village with a vibrant signing community and applies the same feature analysis to adult and child data. We analyse longitudinal data of four deaf children from the Kata Kolok Child Signing Corpus. The form comparison of child productions and adult targets yields three main findings: i) handshape modifications are most frequent, echoing cross-linguistic patterns; ii) modification rates of other features differ from previous studies, possibly due to differences in methodology or KK's phonology; iii) co-occurrence of modifications within a sign suggest feature interdependencies. We argue that nuanced approaches to child signing are necessary to understand the complexity of early signing.

English sentences are lined up to sentences in eleven other languages (BG, CS, DE, EL, HR, IT, NL, PL, PT, RU, ZH) where names and noun phrases (entities) are manually annotated and linked to their respective Wikipedia pages. For every linked entity in English, the corresponding term or phrase in the target language is also marked and linked to its Wikipedia page in that language. The annotation process was performed via crowdsourcing. In this paper we present the task, annotation process, the encountered difficulties with crowdsourcing for complex annotation, and the data set in more detail. We demonstrate the usage of the data set for Wikification evaluation. This data set is valuable as it constitutes a rich resource consisting of annotated data of English text linked to translations in eleven languages including several languages such as Bulgarian and Greek for which not many LT resources are available.

But what happens when the to-be-acquired second language is a sign language? We tested whether hearing nonsigners rely on their gestural repertoire at first exposure to a sign language. Participants saw iconic signs with high and low overlap with the form of iconic gestures while electrophysiological brain activity was recorded. Upon first exposure, signs with low overlap with gestures elicited enhanced positive amplitude in the Pia component compared to signs with high overlap. This effect disappeared after a training session. We conclude that nonsigners generate expectations about the form of iconic signs never seen before based on their implicit knowledge of gestures. even without having to produce them. Learners thus draw from any available semiotic resources when acquiring a second language, and not only from their linguistic experience.

These can help practitioners such as campus managers and directors to further optimize their campus to facilitate unplanned or serendipitous meetings between academic staff and companies. A survey on three Dutch campuses, including questions on both services and locations, was analyzed both spatially and statistically using principal component (PC) and regression analysis. Four PCs were found for services (Relax, Network, Proximity and Availability) and three PCs were found for locations (Aesthetics, Cleaned and Indoor Environment). Personal characteristics as explanatory variables were not significant or only had very small effect sizes, indicating that a campus' design does not need to be tailored to certain user groups but can be effective for all. The pattern of successful locations is discussed, including the variables in each PC. These PCs provide a framework for practitioners who want to improve their campus' design to further facilitate unplanned meetings, thus contributing to cooperation between campus users, hopefully leading to further innovation.

J	Carney, J; Robertson, C; Dávid-Barrett, T				Carney, James; Robertson, Cole; David-Barrett, Tamas			Fictional narrative as a variational Bayesian method for estimating social dispositions in large groups	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; CONSTRUCTION; KINSHIP; COOPERATION; COGNITION; SIZE	Modelling intentions in large groups is cognitively costly. Not alone must first order beliefs be tracked ('what does A think about X?'), but also beliefs about beliefs ('what does A think about B's belief concerning X?'). Thus linear increases in group size impose non-linear increases in cognitive processing resources. At the same time, however, large groups offer coordination advantages relative to smaller groups due to specialisation and increased productive capacity. How might these competing demands be reconciled? We propose that fictional narrative can be understood as a cultural tool for dealing with large groups. Specifically, we argue that prototypical action roles that are removed from real-world interactions function as interpretive priors in a form of variational Bayesian inference, such that they allow estimations can be made of unknown social motives. We offer support for this claim in two ways. Firstly, by evaluating the existing literature on narrative cognition and showing where it anticipates a variational model; and secondly, by simulation, where we show that an agent-based model naturally converges on a set of social categories that resemble narrative across a wide range of starting points.

Readers' Insensitivity to Tense Revealed: No Differences in Mental Simulation During Reading of Present and Past Tense Stories	COLLABRA-PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						mental simulation; story world absorption; verb tense; narratives; eye-tracking	VERB ASPECT; WORD-FREQUENCY; INFORMATION; LANGUAGE; NEED	While the importance of mental simulation during literary reading has long been recognized, we know little about the factors that determine when, what, and how much readers mentally simulate. Here we investigate the influence of a specific text characteristic, namely verb tense (present vs. past), on mental simulation during literary reading. Verbs usually denote the actions and events that take place in narratives and hence it is hypothesized that verb tense will influence the amount of mental simulation elicited in readers. Although the present tense is traditionally considered to be more "vivid", this study is one of the first to experimentally assess this claim. We recorded eye-movements while subjects read stories in the past or present tense and collected data regarding self-reported levels of mental simulation, transportation and appreciation. We found no influence of tense on any of the offline measures. The eye-tracking data showed a slightly more complex pattern. Although we did not find a main effect of sensorimotor simulation content on reading times, we were able to link the degree to which subjects slowed down when reading simulation eliciting content to offline measures of attention and transportation, but this effect did not interact with the tense of the story. Unexpectedly, we found a main effect of tense on reading times per word, with past tense stories eliciting longer first fixation durations and gaze durations.

In sum, this study suggests that tense does not play a substantial role in the process of mental simulation elicited by literary stories.

Evidence from novel-word learning about French schwa deletion	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Novel-word learning; schwa deletion; orthography; spoken-word production; spoken-word recognition	PRONUNCIATION VARIANTS; SPOKEN WORDS; TIME-COURSE; SPEECH; RECOGNITION; KNOWLEDGE; PERCEPTION; CONSISTENCY; ACTIVATION; PHONOLOGY	This study examines the influence of orthography on the processing of reduced word forms. For this purpose, we compared the impact of phonological variation with the impact of spelling-sound consistency on the processing of words that may be produced with or without the vowel schwa. Participants learnt novel French words in which the vowel schwa was present or absent in the first syllable. In Experiment 1, the words were consistently produced without schwa or produced in a variable manner (i.e., sometimes produced with and sometimes produced without schwa). In Experiment 2, words were always produced in a consistent manner, but an orthographic exposure phase was included in which words that were produced without schwa were either spelled with or without the letter < e >. Results from naming and eye-tracking tasks suggest that both phonological variation and spelling-sound consistency influence the processing of spoken novel words. However, the influence of phonological variation outweighs the effect of spelling-sound consistency. Our findings therefore suggest that the influence of orthography on the processing of reduced word forms is relatively small.

Even though the generated texts appear human-like, the main stumbling block is that their output is never fully predictable, which runs the risk of resulting in harmful content such as false statements or inflammatory language. This makes it difficult to apply these models in highly sensitive domains including personal health counselling. Hence, most of the chatbots for highly sensitive domains are developed using pre-scripted approaches. Although pre-scripted approaches are highly controlled, they suffer from repetitiveness and scalability issues. In this paper, we explore the possibility of combining the best of both worlds. We propose and describe in detail a new, flexible expert-driven hybrid architecture for harnessing the benefits of large language models in a controlled manner for highly sensitive domains and discuss the expectations and challenges.

Grammatical development in both languages of bilingual Turkish-Dutch children with and without Developmental Language Disorder	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION			English	Article						language impairment; bilingualism; heritage language; grammatical morphemes; cross-linguistic comparison; longitudinal design; error types; clinical markers	SPEAKING CHILDREN; NONWORD REPETITION; IMMIGRANT CHILDREN; MONOLINGUAL DUTCH; VERB AGREEMENT; IMPAIRMENT; MORPHOLOGY; TENSE; ENGLISH; ACQUISITION	IntroductionTo guarantee a reliable diagnosis of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) in bilingual children, evaluating both languages is recommended. However, little is known about how DLD impacts the heritage language, and it is largely unknown whether bilingual children with DLD develop the heritage language at the same pace as their peers with typical development (TD). MethodsFor this longitudinal study that focused on children's grammatical development, we analyzed semi-spontaneous speech samples of 10 Turkish-Dutch children with DLD (bi-DLD) and 10 Turkish-Dutch children with typical development (bi-TD). Children were 5 or 6 years old at the first wave of data collection, and there were three waves of longitudinal data collection with 1-year intervals. In addition, data from 20 monolingual Dutch controls were analyzed (10 mono-DLD, 10 mono-TD). Results and discussionResults indicate that heritage language assessment can inform clinical diagnosis. In the case of Turkish spoken in the Netherlands, short sentences, the absence of the genitive suffix in simple constructions and avoidance of complex constructions that require possessive marking could potentially be clinical markers of DLD. Accusative case errors are also relatively frequent in bilingual Turkish-Dutch children with DLD, but these are less promising as a clinical marker because previous research suggests that omission and substitution of accusative case can be part of the input to Turkish heritage language learners. In Dutch, frequent omission of grammatical morphemes in the verbal domain coupled with a limited amount of overregularization errors could indicate that a child is at risk for DLD, both in bilingual and monolingual contexts. Cross-linguistic comparisons of error types in Turkish and Dutch confirm that, regardless of typological differences, children with DLD use short sentences, avoid complex structures, and omit grammatical morphemes. Longitudinal analyses revealed that children with DLD can develop the heritage language at the same pace as TD children, even if this language is not supported at school. Strong intergenerational transmission and heritage language maintenance among Turkish migrants in the Netherlands may be key.

New users can profit from the information shared in the forum, Please check if the inserted city and country names in the affiliations are correct. if they can find back the previously posted information. However, discussion threads on a single topic can easily comprise dozens or hundreds of individual posts. Our aim is to summarize forum threads given real web search queries. We created a data set with search queries from a discussion forum's search engine log and the discussion threads that were clicked by the user who entered the query. For 120 thread-query combinations, a reference summary was made by five different human raters. We compared two methods for automatic summarization of the threads: a query-independent method based on post features, and Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR), a method that takes the query into account. We also compared four different word embeddings representations as alternative for standard word vectors in extractive summarization. We find (1) that the agreement between human summarizers does not improve when a query is provided that: (2) the query-independent post features as well as a centroid-based baseline outperform MMR by a large margin; (3) combining the post features with query similarity gives a small improvement over the use of post features alone; and (4) for the word embeddings, a match in domain appears to be more important than corpus size and dimensionality. However, the differences between the models were not reflected by differences in quality of the summaries created with help of these models. We conclude that query-based summarization with web queries is challenging because the queries are short, and a click on a result is not a direct indicator for the relevance of the result.

In our article, we present innovative tools developed for the first large-scale corpus study of codeswitching triggered by cognates. A study of this size was only possible due to the automation of several steps, such as morpheme-by-morpheme glossing, splitting complex clauses into simple clauses, and the analysis of internal and external codeswitching through the use of database tables, algorithms, and a scripting language.

However, most ratings studies present items in isolation, thereby overlooking the potential polysemy of words. Consequently, ratings for polysemous words may be conflated, causing a threat to the validity of concreteness-ratings studies. This is particularly relevant to metaphorical words, which typically describe something abstract in terms of something more concrete. To investigate whether perceived concreteness ratings differ for metaphorical versus non-metaphorical word meanings, we obtained concreteness ratings for 96 English nouns from 230 participants. Results show that nouns are perceived as less concrete when a metaphorical (versus non-metaphorical) meaning is triggered. We thus recommend taking metaphoricity into account in future concreteness-ratings studies to further improve the quality and reliability of such studies, as well as the consistency of the empirical studies that rely on these ratings.

Such associations are thought to arise from innate structural associations in the brain, statistical associations in the environment, via shared affective content, or through language. A developmental perspective on crossmodal associations can help determine which explanations are more likely for specific associations. Certain associations with pitch (e.g., pitch-height) have been observed early in infancy, but others may only occur late into childhood (e.g., pitch-size). In contrast, tactile-chroma associations have been observed in children, but not adults. One modality that has received little attention developmentally is olfaction. In the present investigation, we explored crossmodal associations from sound, tactile stimuli, and odor to a range of stimuli by testing a broad range of participants. Across the three modalities, we found little evidence for crossmodal associations in young children. This suggests an account based on innate structures is unlikely. Instead, the number and strength of associations increased over the lifespan. This suggests that experience plays a crucial role in crossmodal associations from sound, touch, and smell to other senses.

J	Eijk, L; Fletcher, A; McAuliffe, M; Janse, E				Eijk, Lotte; Fletcher, Annalise; McAuliffe, Megan; Janse, Esther			The Effects of Word Frequency and Word Probability on Speech Rhythm in Dysarthria	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							PREDICTING INTELLIGIBILITY GAINS; CONTRASTIVE STRESS; DURATION; SEGMENTATION; INDIVIDUALS; PERCEPTION; REDUNDANCY; SPEAKING; DISEASE; TALKER	Purpose: In healthy speakers, the more frequent and probable a word is in its context, the shorter the word tends to be. This study investigated whether these probabilistic effects were similarly sized for speakers with dysarthria of different seventies. Method: Fifty-six speakers of New Zealand English (42 speakers with dysarthria and 14 healthy speakers) were recorded reading the Grandfather Passage. Measurements of word duration, frequency, and transitional word probability were taken. Results: As hypothesized, words with a higher frequency and probability tended to be shorter in duration. There was also a significant interaction between word frequency and speech severity. This indicated that the more severe the dysarthria, the smaller the effects of word frequency on speakers' word durations. Transitional word probability also interacted with speech severity, but did not account for significant unique variance in the full model. Conclusions: These results suggest that, as the severity of dysarthria increases, the duration of words is less affected by probabilistic variables. These findings may be due to reductions in the control and execution of muscle movement exhibited by speakers with dysarthria.

This prosodic parsing ability is well-attested and is a cornerstone to the development of speech perception and grammar. However, infants also receive linguistic input in child songs. This study provides evidence that infants parse songs into meaningful phrasal units and replicates previous research for speech. Six-month-old Dutch infants (n = 80) were tested in the song or speech modality in the head-turn preference procedure. First, infants were familiarized to two versions of the same word sequence: One version represented a well-formed unit, and the other contained a phrase boundary halfway through. At test, infants were presented two passages, each containing one version of the familiarized sequence. The results for speech replicated the previously observed preference for the passage containing the well-formed sequence, but only in a more fine-grained analysis. The preference for well-formed phrases was also observed in the song modality, indicating that infants recognize phrase structure in song. There were acoustic differences between stimuli of the current and previous studies, suggesting that infants are flexible in their processing of boundary cues while also providing a possible explanation for differences in effect sizes.

It confirms that, in natural bilingual speech, lexical selection of cognates can facilitate codeswitching by enhancing the activation of the non-selected language. Analyses of a large-scale corpus of Welsh-English conversational speech showed that 1) producing cognates facilitated codeswitching, 2) speakers who generally produced more cognates generally codeswitched more, even in clauses that did not contain cognates, 3) larger numbers of cognates in a clause increased the likelihood of codeswitching, 4) codeswitching temporarily remained facilitated after the production of cognates, and 5) hearing rather than producing cognates did not facilitate codeswitching. The findings confirm the validity of the proposed cognitive account of triggered codeswitching, and clarify the relation between the lexical activation of cognates and consecutive language choice, in accord with current insights in lexical processing.

Few studies have investigated potential effects of blindness on memory across long time frames, such as months or years. Consequently, it was unclear whether compensatory effects may vary as a function of retention interval. In this study, we followed-up participants (N = 57 out of 60) approximately 1 year after the initial testing and retested episodic recognition for environmental sounds and odors, and identification ability. In contrast to our previous findings, the early blind participants (n = 14) performed at a similar level as the late blind (n = 13) and sighted (n = 30) participants for sound recognition. Moreover, the groups had similar recognition performance of odors and identification ability of odors and sounds. These findings suggest that episodic odor memory is unaffected by blindness after both short and long retention intervals. However, the effect of blindness on episodic memory for sounds may vary as a function of retention interval, such that early blind individuals have an advantage over sighted across short but not long time frames. We speculate that the finding of a differential effect of blindness on auditory episodic memory across retention intervals may be related to different memory strategies at initial and follow-up assessments. In conclusion, this study suggests that blindness does not influence auditory or olfactory episodic memory as assessed after a long retention interval.

To address this, we compared congenitally blind, blindfolded, and sighted people's descriptions of the same motion events experienced auditorily by all participants (i.e., via sound alone) and conveyed in speech and gesture. Comparison of blind and sighted participants to blindfolded participants helped us disentangle the effects of a lifetime experience of being blind versus the task-specific effects of experiencing a motion event by sound alone. Compared to sighted people, blind people's speech focused more on path and less on manner of motion, and encoded paths in a more segmented fashion using more landmarks and path verbs. Gestures followed the speech, such that blind people pointed to landmarks more and depicted manner less than sighted people. This suggests that visual experience affects how people express spatial events in the multimodal language and that blindness may enhance sensitivity to paths of motion due to changes in event construal. These findings have implications for the claims that language processes are deeply rooted in our sensory experiences.

Good prognostication for example helps to determine the course of treatment and helps to anticipate the procurement of health care services and facilities, or more broadly: facilitates Advance Care Planning. Advance Care Planning improves the quality of the final phase of life by stimulating doctors to explore the preferences for end-of-life care with their patients, and people close to the patients. Physicians, however, tend to overestimate life expectancy, and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care Planning. This research tests the potential of using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for predicting life expectancy from electronic medical records.MethodsWe approached the task of predicting life expectancy as a supervised machine learning task. We trained and tested a long short-term memory recurrent neural network on the medical records of deceased patients. We developed the model with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, and evaluated its performance on a held-out set of test data. We compared the performance of a model which does not use text features (baseline model) to the performance of a model which uses features extracted from the free texts of the medical records (keyword model), and to doctors' performance on a similar task as described in scientific literature.ResultsBoth doctors and the baseline model were correct in 20% of the cases, taking a margin of 33% around the actual life expectancy as the target. The keyword model, in comparison, attained an accuracy of 29% with its prognoses. While doctors overestimated life expectancy in 63% of the incorrect prognoses, which harms anticipation to appropriate end-of-life care, the keyword model overestimated life expectancy in only 31% of the incorrect prognoses.ConclusionsPrognostication of life expectancy is difficult for humans. Our research shows that machine learning and natural language processing techniques offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The research has potential for real-life applications, such as supporting timely recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning.

Distinguishing Syntactic Operations in the Brain: Dependency and Phrase-Structure Parsing	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE			English	Article						neural basis of syntactic processing; dependency grammar; phrase structure grammar; functional MRI; anterior temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus		Finding the structure of a sentence-the way its words hold together to convey meaning-is a fundamental step in language comprehension. Several brain regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, and the left anterior temporal pole, are supposed to support this operation. The exact role of these areas is nonetheless still debated. In this paper we investigate the hypothesis that different brain regions could be sensitive to different kinds of syntactic computations. We compare the fit of phrase-structure and dependency structure descriptors to activity in brain areas using fMRI. Our results show a division between areas with regard to the type of structure computed, with the left anterior temporal pole and left inferior frontal gyrus favouring dependency structures and left posterior superior temporal gyrus favouring phrase structures.

We investigate whether experts are better able to imagine smells and tastes because they have learned the ability, or whether they are better imaginers in the first place, and so become experts. To test this, we first compared a group of wine experts to yoked novices using a battery of questionnaires. We show for the first time that experts report greater vividness of wine imagery, with no difference in vividness across sensory modalities. In contrast, novices had more vivid color imagery than taste or odor imagery for wines. Experts and novices did not differ on other vividness of imagery measures, suggesting a domain-specific effect of expertise. Critically, in a second study, we followed a group of students commencing a wine course and a group of matched control participants. Students and controls did not differ before the course, but after the wine course students reported more vivid wine imagery. We provide evidence that expertise improves imagery, exemplifying the extent of plasticity of cognition underlying the chemical senses.

How does the constrained poetic structure facilitate speech segmentation when common linguistic [ ] and statistical cues [5, 9] are unreliable to listeners in poems? We generated artificial Jueju, which arguably has the most constrained structure in ancient Chinese poetry, and presented each poem twice as an isochronous sequence of syllables to native Mandarin speakers while conducting magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. We found that listeners deployed their prior knowledge of Jueju to build the line structure and to establish the conceptual flow of Jueju. Un precedentedly, we found a phase precession phenomenon indicating predictive processes of speech segmentation-the neural phase advanced faster after listeners acquired knowledge of incoming speech. The statistical co-occurrence of monosyllabic words in Jueju negatively correlated with speech segmentation, which provides an alternative perspective on how statistical cues facilitate speech segmentation. Our findings suggest that constrained poetic structures serve as a temporal map for listeners to group speech contents and to predict incoming speech signals. Listeners can parse speech streams by using not only grammatical and statistical cues but also their prior knowledge of the form of language.

In this study, we investigated whether infants can already recognize this phonological pattern in songs. Earlier studies using lists of spoken words were equivocal on infants' spontaneous processing of rhymes (Hayes et al., 2000; Jusczyk et al., 1999). Songs, however, constitute an ecologically valid rhyming stimulus, which could allow for spontaneous processing of this phonological pattern in infants. Novel children's songs with rhyming and non-rhyming lyrics using pseudo-words were presented to 35 9-month-old Dutch infants using the Headturn Preference Procedure. Infants on average listened longer to the non-rhyming songs, with around half of the infants however exhibiting a preference for the rhyming songs. These results highlight that infants have the processing abilities to benefit from their natural rhyming input for the development of their phonological abilities.

A systematic review	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Review						Illiteracy; Low literate; Adult basic education; Dyslexia; Reading; Comprehension	VOWEL LENGTH DISCRIMINATION; ADULT LITERACY STUDENTS; DIAGNOSTIC SUBGROUPS; READING DISABILITIES; PROCESSING DEFICIT; COMPONENT SKILLS; FRENCH ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; CHILDREN; PHONICS	A considerable amount of the population in more economically developed countries are functionally illiterate (i.e., low literate). Despite some years of schooling and basic reading skills, these individuals cannot properly read and write and, as a consequence have problems to understand even short texts. An often-discussed approach (Greenberg et al. 1997) assumes weak phonological processing skills coupled with untreated developmental dyslexia as possible causes of functional illiteracy. Although there is some data suggesting commonalities between low literacy and developmental dyslexia, it is still not clear, whether these reflect shared consequences (i.e., cognitive and behavioral profile) or shared causes. The present systematic review aims at exploring the similarities and differences identified in empirical studies investigating both functional illiterate and developmental dyslexic samples. Nine electronic databases were searched in order to identify all quantitative studies published in English or German. Although a broad search strategy and few limitations were applied, only 5 studies have been identified adequate from the resulting 9269 references. The results point to the lack of studies directly comparing functional illiterate with developmental dyslexic samples. Moreover, a huge variance has been identified between the studies in how they approached the concept of functional illiteracy, particularly when it came to critical categories such the applied definition, terminology, criteria for inclusion in the sample, research focus, and outcome measures. The available data highlight the need for more direct comparisons in order to understand what extent functional illiteracy and dyslexia share common characteristics.

The motivation behind HyLECA lies in enhancing user engagement and enjoyment in task-oriented chatbots by leveraging the natural language generation capabilities of open-domain large language models within the confines of predetermined dialogue flows. Moreover, we discuss the technical capabilities, potential applications, relevance, and adaptability of the system.

Anticipatory Processing in a Verb-Initial Mayan Language: Eye-Tracking Evidence During Sentence Comprehension in Tseltal	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Prediction; Sentence comprehension; Anticipatory eye movements; Verb-initial word order; Tseltal	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SPOKEN-LANGUAGE; VISUAL WORLD; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PROACTIVE BRAIN; UPCOMING WORDS; PREDICTION; INFORMATION; MOVEMENTS; TIME	We present a visual world eye-tracking study on Tseltal (a Mayan language) and investigate whether verbal information can be used to anticipate an upcoming referent. Basic word order in transitive sentences in Tseltal is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS). The verb is usually encountered first, making argument structure and syntactic information available at the outset, which should facilitate anticipation of the post-verbal arguments. Tseltal speakers listened to verb-initial sentences with either an object-predictive verb (e.g., "eat") or a general verb (e.g., "look for") (e.g., "Ya slo'/sle ta stukel on te kereme," Is eating/is looking (for) by himself the avocado the boy/ "The boy is eating/is looking (for) an avocado by himself") while seeing a visual display showing one potential referent (e.g., avocado) and three distractors (e.g., bag, toy car, coffee grinder). We manipulated verb type (predictive vs. general) and recorded participants' eye movements while they listened and inspected the visual scene. Participants' fixations to the target referent were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression models. Shortly after hearing the predictive verb, participants fixated the target object before it was mentioned. In contrast, when the verb was general, fixations to the target only started to increase once the object was heard. Our results suggest that Tseltal hearers pre-activate semantic features of the grammatical object prior to its linguistic expression. This provides evidence from a verb-initial language for online incremental semantic interpretation and anticipatory processing during language comprehension. These processes are comparable to the ones identified in subject-initial languages, which is consistent with the notion that different languages follow similar universal processing principles.

Sleep quality is associated with emotion experience and adaptive regulation of positive emotion: An experience sampling study	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						ecological momentary assessment; emotion regulation; negative emotion; positive emotion; sleep	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS; HEALTH OUTCOMES; ADOLESCENT; MOOD; SYMPTOMS; ANXIETY; METAANALYSIS; RESTRICTION; DISORDERS	Poor sleep patterns have been strongly linked to disrupted emotional experiences. Emotion regulation, defined as the capacity to manage one's own emotional responses, comprises strategies to increase, maintain, or decrease the intensity, duration, and trajectory of positive and negative emotions. Poor sleep has been identified as a risk factor for emotional dysregulation, but most of the focus has been on negative emotion regulation. We therefore asked whether natural variations in sleep are associated with the experience and regulation of both positive and negative emotion. Young adults, aged between 18-24 years (N = 101), completed 7 days of ecological momentary assessments using a smartphone application. Duration and quality of the previous night's sleep was reported each morning. Levels of positive and negative emotions, and strategies used to regulate emotions, were measured at pseudorandom timepoints four times a day. Multilevel modelling indicated that higher self-reported sleep quality was significantly associated with increased intensity and duration of positive emotion, and decreased intensity of negative emotion. There were no statistically significant associations between sleep duration and emotion intensity or duration. Sleep quality, and not sleep duration, was also associated with the reported use of positive emotion regulation strategies. For negative emotion regulation strategy use, we found no associations with sleep quality or duration. Naturally occurring fluctuations in daily sleep quality may be important for the experience and regulation of positive emotion in young adults. These findings emphasise the need to examine both positive and negative emotion, and emotion regulation to understand the links between sleep and mood.

Grounding the neurobiology of language in first principles: The necessity of non-language-centric explanations for language comprehension	COGNITION			English	Article						Language; Neurobiology; Context	HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BROCAS AREA; INTERSUBJECT CORRELATIONS; DISCOURSE COMPREHENSION; CAUSAL INFERENCES	Recent decades have ushered in tremendous progress in understanding the neural basis of language. Most of our current knowledge on language and the brain, however, is derived from lab-based experiments that are far removed from everyday language use, and that are inspired by questions originating in linguistic and psycholinguistic contexts. In this paper we argue that in order to make progress, the field needs to shift its focus to understanding the neurobiology of naturalistic language comprehension. We present here a new conceptual framework for understanding the neurobiological organization of language comprehension. This framework is non-language-centered in the computational/neurobiological constructs it identifies, and focuses strongly on context. Our core arguments address three general issues: (i) the difficulty in extending language-centric explanations to discourse; (ii) the necessity of taking context as a serious topic of study, modeling it formally and acknowledging the limitations on external validity when studying language comprehension outside context; and (iii) the tenuous status of the language network as an explanatory construct. We argue that adopting this framework means that neurobiological studies of language will be less focused on identifying correlations between brain activity patterns and mechanisms postulated by psycholinguistic theories. Instead, they will be less self-referential and increasingly more inclined towards integration of language with other cognitive systems, ultimately doing more justice to the neurobiological organization of language and how it supports language as it is used in everyday life.

Children with Down syndrome (<= 18 years) were included between March 2012 and June 2014. Caregivers received a baseline questionnaire with follow-up 1-2 years after inclusion. Caregivers received a weekly questionnaire about respiratory symptoms, fever, antibiotic prescriptions, doctor's visits, and consequences for school and work attendance. Children with Down syndrome were compared to a cohort of the general population ("Kind en Ziek" study) with similar weekly questionnaires. A total of 9,011 childweeks were reported for 116 participants with Down syndrome (75% response rate). The frequency of respiratory symptoms was higher in children with Down syndrome than in children from the general population (30% vs 15.2%). In addition, symptoms subsided later (around 8 vs 5 years of age). The seasonal influence was limited, both in children with Down syndrome and children from the general population. Consequences of respiratory disease were significant in children with Down syndrome compared to children from the general population, with a higher rate of doctor's visits (21.3% vs 11.8%), antibiotic prescriptions (47.8% vs 26.3%), and absenteeism from school (55.5% vs 25.4%) and work (parents, 9.4% vs 8.1%). Conclusion: Children with Down syndrome have a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms and symptoms last until a later age, confirming the impression of professionals and caregivers. Individualized treatment plans might prevent unfavorable consequences of chronic recurrent respiratory disease in children with Down syndrome. What is Known: Children with Down syndrome have an altered immune system and are prone to a more severe course of respiratory tract infections. The overall conception is that patients with Down syndrome suffer from respiratory tract infections more often. What is New: Children with Down syndrome suffer from respiratory symptoms more frequently than children from the general population. The respiratory symptoms in children with Down syndrome subside at a later age compared to children from the general population.

Critically, this does not depend on more efficient use of language. However, this conclusion is based mainly on findings from experts in visual and auditory domains. Olfactory experts constitute an interesting potential counterexample since language has been implicated to be critically involved in odor memory in previous studies. We examined the role language plays in odor recognition memory for wine experts, who typically display better wine odor memory than novices and who are also able to name odors better than lay people. This suggests wine experts' superior recognition memory for odors may be verbally mediated. In 2 experiments, recognition memory for wine odors, wine-related odors, and common odors was tested in wine experts and novices. The use of language was manipulated in Experiment 1 with an overt naming versus no-naming condition, and in Experiment 2, with a verbal interference task inhibiting covert verbalization. Across the two experiments the results showed wine experts have better recognition memory for wines, but not for wine-related or common odors, indicating their memory advantage is expertise specific. Critically, this effect was not verbally mediated, as there was no relationship between experts' ability to name wines and their memory for them. Likewise, directly inhibiting online use of verbalization did not affect memory for wine odors in experts. In sum, once expertise has been acquired, language does not play a causal role in recognition memory for odors.

Olfactory language and abstraction across cultures	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						olfaction; culture; language; abstract; Jahai; Dutch	ODOR; PERCEPTION; WORDS	Olfaction presents a particularly interesting arena to explore abstraction in language. Like other abstract domains, such as time, odours can be difficult to conceptualize. An odour cannot be seen or held, it can be difficult to locate in space, and for most people odours are difficult to verbalize. On the other hand, odours give rise to primary sensory experiences. Every time we inhale we are using olfaction to make sense of our environment. We present new experimental data from 30 Jahai hunter-gatherers from the Malay Peninsula and 30 matched Dutch participants from the Netherlands in an odour naming experiment. Participants smelled monomolecular odorants and named odours while reaction times, odour descriptors and facial expressions were measured. We show that while Dutch speakers relied on concrete descriptors, i.e. they referred to odour sources (e.g. smells like lemon), the Jahai used abstract vocabulary to name the same odours (e.g. musty). Despite this differential linguistic categorization, analysis of facial expressions showed that the two groups, nevertheless, had the same initial emotional reactions to odours. Critically, these cross-cultural data present a challenge for how to think about abstraction in language.

They demonstrated that people who are pre-exposed to weakened arguments against an attitude or position they currently hold (i.e., inoculated) are less affected by a subsequent strong counter-attitudinal message than people who are pre-exposed to arguments consistent with their attitude (i.e., supportive defense treatment) or to no arguments. Although these results significantly impacted both science and practice on a general level, rigid tests of the key theoretical propositions are lacking. We conducted a highly powered replication study (N = 679) and found that an inoculation treatment is more effective in increasing resistance toward persuasion compared to a supportive defense treatment and a no-treatment control condition. Our results were mostly consistent with McGuire and Papageorgis's original work.

Analyzing Empowerment Processes Among Cancer Patients in an Online Community: A Text Mining Approach	JMIR CANCER			English	Article						cancer; health communication; online social networking; empowerment; text mining; machine learning	BREAST-CANCER; SUPPORT GROUPS; PARTICIPATION; OUTCOMES; LURKERS; BENEFITS; POSTERS; WOMEN	Background: Peer-to-peer online support groups and the discussion forums in these groups can help patients by providing opportunities for increasing their empowerment. Most previous research on online empowerment and online social support uses qualitative methods or questionnaires to gain insight into the dynamics of online empowerment processes. Objective: The overall goal of this study was to analyze the presence of the empowerment processes in the online peer-to-peer communication of people affected by cancer, using text mining techniques. Use of these relatively new methods enables us to study social processes such as empowerment on a large scale and with unsolicited data. Methods: The sample consisted of 5534 messages in 1708 threads, written by 2071 users of a forum for cancer patients and their relatives. We labeled the posts in our sample with 2 types of labels: labels referring to empowerment processes and labels denoting psychological processes. The latter were identified using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) method. Both groups of labels were automatically assigned to posts. Automatic labeling of the empowerment processes was done by text classifiers trained on a manually labeled subsample. For the automatic labeling of the LIWC categories, we used the Dutch version of the LIWC consisting of a total of 66 word categories that are assigned to text based on occurrences of words in the text. After the automatic labeling with both types of labels, we investigated (1) the relationship between empowerment processes and the intensity of online participation, (2) the relationship between empowerment processes and the LIWC categories, and (3) the differences between patients with different types of cancer. Results: The precision of the automatic labeling was 85.6%, which we considered to be sufficient for automatically labeling the complete corpus and doing further analyses on the labeled data. Overall, 62.94% (3482/5532) of the messages contained a narrative, 23.83% (1318/5532) a question, and 27.49% (1521/5532) informational support. Emotional support and references to external sources were less frequent. Users with more posts more often referred to an external source and more often provided informational support and emotional support (Kendall tau>0.2; P<.001) and less often shared narratives (Kendall tau=-0.297; P<.001). A number of LIWC categories are significant predictors for the empowerment processes: words expressing assent (ok and yes) and emotional processes (expressions of feelings) are significant positive predictors for emotional support (P=.002). The differences between patients with different types of cancer are small. Conclusions: Empowerment processes are associated with the intensity of online use. The relationship between linguistic analyses and empowerment processes indicates that empowerment processes can be identified from the occurrences of specific linguistic cues denoting psychological processes.

Lost in a Story, Detached from the Words	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article								This article explores the relationship between low- and high-level aspects of reading by studying the interplay between word processing, as measured with eye tracking, and narrative absorption and liking, as measured with questionnaires. Specifically, we focused on how individual differences in sensitivity to lexical word characteristics-measured as the effect of these characteristics on gaze duration-were related to narrative absorption and liking. By reanalyzing a large data set consisting of three previous eye-tracking experiments in which subjects (N = 171) read literary short stories, we replicated the well-established finding that word length, lemma frequency, position in sentence, age of acquisition, and orthographic neighborhood size of words influenced gaze duration. More importantly, we found that individual differences in the degree of sensitivity to three of these word characteristics, i.e., word length, lemma frequency, and age of acquisition, were negatively related to print exposure and to a lesser degree to narrative absorption and liking. Even though the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear, we believe the current findings underline the need to map out the interplay between, on the one hand, the technical and, on the other hand, the subjective processes of reading by studying reading behavior in more natural settings.

The case of font readability in poetry appreciation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROCESSING FLUENCY; DISFLUENCY; LANGUAGE; FEATURES	Previous research shows conflicting findings for the effect of font readability on comprehension and memory for language. It has been found that-perhaps counterintuitively-a hard to read font can be beneficial for language comprehension, especially for difficult language. Here we test how font readability influences the subjective experience of poetry reading. In three experiments we tested the influence of poem difficulty and font readability on the subjective experience of poems. We specifically predicted that font readability would have opposite effects on the subjective experience of easy versus difficult poems. Participants read poems which could be more or less difficult in terms of conceptual or structural aspects, and which were presented in a font that was either easy or more difficult to read. Participants read existing poems and subsequently rated their subjective experience (measured through four dependent variables: overall liking, perceived flow of the poem, perceived topic clarity, and perceived structure). In line with previous literature we observed a Poem Difficulty x Font Readability interaction effect for subjective measures of poetry reading. We found that participants rated easy poems as nicer when presented in an easy to read font, as compared to when presented in a hard to read font. Despite the presence of the interaction effect, we did not observe the predicted opposite effect for more difficult poems. We conclude that font readability can influence reading of easy and more difficult poems differentially, with strongest effects for easy poems.

Dutch and German have a binary voicing contrast, but the contrast is implemented with different VOT values in the two languages. The results suggest that bilingual children produce voiced' plosives similarly in their two languages, and these productions are not monolingual-like in either language. Bidirectional cross-linguistic influence between Dutch and German can explain these results. Yet, the bilinguals seemingly have two autonomous categories for Dutch and German voiceless' plosives. In German, the bilinguals' aspiration is not monolingual-like, but bilinguals with more heritage language exposure produce more target-like aspiration. Importantly, the amount of exposure to German has no effect on the majority language's voiceless' category. This implies that more heritage language exposure is associated with more language-specific voicing systems.

While the linguistic and cognitive evidence for lexical tone is therefore beyond dispute, the word prosodic systems of many languages continue to escape the categorizations of typologists. One controversy concerns the existence of a typological class of "pitch accent languages," another the underlying phonological nature of surface tone contrasts, which in some cases have been claimed to be metrical rather than tonal. We address the question whether the Sequence Recall Task (SRT), which has been shown to discriminate between languages with and without word stress, can distinguish languages with and without lexical tone. Using participants from non-tonal Indonesian, semi-tonal Swedish, and two varieties of tonal Mandarin, we ran SRTs with monosyllabic tonal contrasts to test the hypothesis that high performance in a tonal SRT indicates the lexical status of tone. An additional question concerned the extent to which accuracy scores depended on phonological and phonetic properties of a language's tone system, like its complexity, the existence of an experimental contrast in a language's phonology, and the phonetic salience of a contrast. The results suggest that a tonal SRT is not likely to discriminate between tonal and non-tonal languages within a typologically varied group, because of the effects of specific properties of their tone systems. Future research should therefore address the first hypothesis with participants from otherwise similar tonal and non-tonal varieties of the same language, where results from a tonal SRT may make a useful contribution to the typological debate on word prosody.

It has been claimed that development of this area proceeds by impinging upon territory otherwise available for the processing of culturally relevant stimuli such as faces and houses. In a large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging study of a group of individuals of varying degrees of literacy (from completely illiterate to highly literate), we examined cortical responses to orthographic and nonorthographic visual stimuli. We found that literacy enhances responses to other visual input in early visual areas and enhances representational similarity between text and faces, without reducing the extent of response to nonorthographic input. Thus, acquisition of literacy in childhood recycles existing object representation mechanisms but without destructive competition.

Multimodality and the origin of a novel communication system in face-to-face interaction	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						language evolution; multimodality; gesture; vocalization; interaction	CO-SPEECH GESTURES; CULTURAL-EVOLUTION; TURN-TAKING; ICONIC GESTURES; LANGUAGE; ORGANIZATION; EMERGENCE; SPEAKERS; INTEGRATION; PANTOMIME	Face-to-face communication is multimodal at its core: it consists of a combination of vocal and visual signalling. However, current evidence suggests that, in the absence of an established communication system, visual signalling, especially in the form of visible gesture, is a more powerful form of communication than vocalization and therefore likely to have played a primary role in the emergence of human language. This argument is based on experimental evidence of how vocal and visual modalities (i.e. gesture) are employed to communicate about familiar concepts when participants cannot use their existing languages. To investigate this further, we introduce an experiment where pairs of participants performed a referential communication task in which they described unfamiliar stimuli in order to reduce reliance on conventional signals. Visual and auditory stimuli were described in three conditions: using visible gestures only, using non-linguistic vocalizations only and given the option to use both (multimodal communication). The results suggest that even in the absence of conventional signals, gesture is a more powerful mode of communication compared with vocalization, but that there are also advantages to multimodality compared to using gesture alone. Participants with an option to produce multimodal signals had comparable accuracy to those using only gesture, but gained an efficiency advantage. The analysis of the interactions between participants showed that interactants developed novel communication systems for unfamiliar stimuli by deploying different modalities flexibly to suit their needs and by taking advantage of multimodality when required.

Extrafoveal attentional capture by object semantics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-SEARCH; EYE-MOVEMENTS; TARGET TEMPLATE; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; FIXATION; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE; GUIDANCE; SALIENCY	There is ongoing debate on whether object meaning can be processed outside foveal vision, making semantics available for attentional guidance. Much of the debate has centred on whether objects that do not fit within an overall scene draw attention, in complex displays that are often difficult to control. Here, we revisited the question by reanalysing data from three experiments that used displays consisting of standalone objects from a carefully controlled stimulus set. Observers searched for a target object, as per auditory instruction. On the critical trials, the displays contained no target but objects that were semantically related to the target, visually related, or unrelated. Analyses using ( generalized) linear mixed-effects models showed that, although visually related objects attracted most attention, semantically related objects were also fixated earlier in time than unrelated objects. Moreover, semantic matches affected the very first saccade in the display. The amplitudes of saccades that first entered semantically related objects were larger than 5 degrees on average, confirming that object semantics is available outside foveal vision. Finally, there was no semantic capture of attention for the same objects when observers did not actively look for the target, confirming that it was not stimulus-driven. We discuss the implications for existing models of visual cognition.

For example, in English, iconic words include peep and crash, which mimic the sounds they denote, and wiggle and zigzag, which mimic motion. As a semiotic property of words and signs, iconicity has been demonstrated to play a role in word learning, language processing, and language evolution. This paper presents the results of a large-scale norming study for more than 14,000 English words conducted with over 1400 American English speakers. We demonstrate the utility of these ratings by replicating a number of existing findings showing that iconicity ratings are related to age of acquisition, sensory modality, semantic neighborhood density, structural markedness, and playfulness. We discuss possible use cases and limitations of the rating dataset, which is made publicly available.

Not by Enhancing Cortical Responses to Speech, But by Promoting Connectivity of Acoustic-Phonetic and Graphomotor Cortices	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GMFA; reading; speech perception; VWFA; writing	SEX-DIFFERENCES; READING ACQUISITION; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; PRINT; FMRI; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	Previous research suggests that literacy, specifically learning alphabetic letter-to-phoneme mappings, modifies online speech processing and enhances brain responses, as indexed by the BOLD, to speech in auditory areas associated with phonological processing (Dehaene et al., 2010). However, alphabets are not the only orthographic systems in use in the world, and hundreds of millions of individuals speak languages that are not written using alphabets. In order to make claims that literacy per se has broad and general consequences for brain responses to speech, one must seek confirmatory evidence from nonalphabetic literacy. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal fMRI study in India probing the effect of literacy in Devanagari, an abubgida, on functional connectivity and cerebral responses to speech in 91 variously literate Hindi-speaking male and female human participants. Twenty-two completely illiterate participants underwent 6 months of reading and writing training. Devanagari literacy increases functional connectivity between acoustic-phonetic and graphomotor brain areas, but we find no evidence that literacy changes brain responses to speech, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. These findings shows that a dramatic reconfiguration of the neurofunctional substrates of online speech processing may not be a universal result of learning to read, and suggest that the influence of writing on speech processing should also be investigated.

Yet, little is known about the relation between bilingual preschoolers' speech production and their speech input. The present study investigated the production of voice onset time (VOT) by Dutch-German bilingual preschoolers and their sequential bilingual mothers. The findings reveal an association between maternal VOT and bilingual children's VOT in the heritage language German as well as in the majority language Dutch. By contrast, no input-production association was observed in the VOT production of monolingual German-speaking children and monolingual Dutch-speaking children. The results of this study provide the first empirical evidence that non-native and attrited maternal speech contributes to the often-observed linguistic differences between bilingual children and their monolingual peers.

Children's and adults' use of fictional discourse and semantic knowledge for prediction in language processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCRIPT-BASED STORIES; ATYPICAL ACTIONS; TIME-COURSE; NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION; REAL; RECOGNITION; CONSTRAINTS; ANOMALIES; CONTEXT; MEMORY	Using real-time eye-movement measures, we asked how a fantastical discourse context competes with stored representations of real-world events to influence the moment-by-moment interpretation of a story by 7-year-old children and adults. Seven-year-olds were less effective at bypassing stored real-world knowledge during real-time interpretation than adults. Our results suggest that children privilege stored semantic knowledge over situation-specific information presented in a fictional story context. We suggest that 7-year-olds' canonical semantic and conceptual relations are sufficiently strongly rooted in statistical patterns in language that have consolidated over time that they overwhelm new and unexpected information even when the latter is fantastical and highly salient.

It is associated with autistic traits and autismrelated perceptual processing characteristics, including a more detail-focused attentional style and altered sensory sensitivity. In addition, these characteristics correlate with the degree of grapheme-color synesthesia (consistency of grapheme-color associations) in non- synesthetes. We investigated a predominantly non-synesthetic twin sample, including individuals fulfilling criteria for an autism spectrum diagnosis or other neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 65, 14-34 years, 60% female). We modelled linear relationships between the degree of grapheme-color synesthesia and autistic traits, sensory sensitivity, and visual perception, both within-twin pairs (22 pairs) where all factors shared by twins are implicitly controlled (including 50-100% genetics), and across the entire cohort. We found that the degree of grapheme-color synesthesia was associated with autistic traits within the domain of Attention to Details and with sensory hyper-, but not hyposensitivity. These associations were stronger within-twin pairs than across the sample. Further, twins with a higher degree of grapheme-color synesthesia were better than their co-twins at identifying fragmented images (Fragmented Pictures Test). This is the first twin study on the association between synesthesia and autism-related perceptual features and traits. The results suggest that investigating these associations within-twin pairs, implicitly adjusting for potential confounding factors shared by twins, is more sensitive than doing so in non-related individuals. Consistent with previous findings, the results suggest an association between the degree of grapheme-color synesthesia and autism-related perceptual features, while utilizing a different measure for sensory sensitivity. The novel finding of enhanced fragmented picture integration in twins with a higher degree of grapheme-color synesthesia challenges the view of a generally more detail-focused attentional style in synesthesia and might be related to enhanced memory or mental imagery in more synesthetic individuals.

The Storytelling Brain: How Neuroscience Stories Help Bridge the Gap between Research and Society	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						science communication; storytelling; science outreach; broader impact; science reporting; scientific journalism	SCIENTISTS STRUGGLES; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; SIMULATION; PRINCIPLES; NETWORK; FICTION	Active communication between researchers and society is necessary for the scientific community's involvement in developing science-based policies. This need is recognized by governmental and funding agencies that compel scientists to increase their public engagement and disseminate research findings in an accessible fashion. Storytelling techniques can help convey science by engaging people's imagination and emotions. Yet, many researchers are uncertain about how to approach scientific storytelling, or feel they lack the tools to undertake it. Here we explore some of the techniques intrinsic to crafting scientific narratives, as well as the reasons why scientific storytelling may be an optimal way of communicating research to nonspecialists. We also point out current communication gaps between science and society, particularly in the context of neurodiverse audiences and those that include neurological and psychiatric patients. Present shortcomings may turn into areas of synergy with the potential to link neuroscience education, research, and advocacy.

This seems to be a contradiction, and wine expert descriptions are frequently received with criticism. Here, we propose a method for probing the language of wine reviews, and thus offer a means to enhance current vocabularies, and as a by-product question the general assumption that wine reviews are gibberish. By means of two different quantitative analyses-support vector machines for classification and Termhood analysis-on a corpus of online wine reviews, we tested whether wine reviews are written in a consistent manner, and thus may be considered informative; and whether reviews feature domain-specific language. First, a classification paradigm was trained on wine reviews from one set of authors for which the color, grape variety, and origin of a wine were known, and subsequently tested on data from a new author. This analysis revealed that, regardless of individual differences in vocabulary preferences, color and grape variety were predicted with high accuracy. Second, using Termhood as a measure of how words are used in wine reviews in a domain-specific manner compared to other genres in English, a list of 146 wine-specific terms was uncovered. These words were compared to existing lists of wine vocabulary that are currently used to train experts. Some overlap was observed, but there were also gaps revealed in the extant lists, suggesting these lists could be improved by our automatic analysis.

A convincing and complete explanation for the direction and locus of this association remains, however, elusive. In this study, we investigated rapid automatized naming (RAN) of everyday objects and basic color patches in neurotypical illiterate and literate adults. Literacy acquisition and education enhanced RAN performance for both conceptual categories but this advantage was much larger for (abstract) colors than everyday objects. This result suggests that (a) literacy/education may be causal for serial rapid naming ability of non-alphanumeric items and (b) differences in the lexical quality of conceptual representations can underlie the reading-related differential RAN performance.

J	Rojas-Berscia, LM; Napurí, A; Wang, L				Rojas-Berscia, Luis Miguel; Napuri, Andres; Wang, Lei			Shawi (Chayahuita)	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Shawi(1) is the language of the indigenous Shawi/Chayahuita people in Northwestern Amazonia, Peru. It belongs to the Kawapanan language family, together with its moribund sister language, Shiwilu. It is spoken by about 21,000 speakers (see Rojas-Berscia 2013) in the provinces of Alto Amazonas and Datem del Maranon in the region of Loreto and in the northern part of the region of San Martin, being one of the most vital languages in the country (see Figure 1).(2) Although Shawi groups in the Upper Amazon were contacted by Jesuit missionaries during colonial times, the maintenance of their customs and language is striking. To date, most Shawi children are monolingual and have their first contact with Spanish at school. Yet, due to globalisation and the construction of highways by the Peruvian government, many Shawi villages are progressively westernising. This may result in the imminent loss of their indigenous culture and language.

Previous studies have shown that children integrate information from both modalities. Yet it is not known whether children can integrate both types of information simultaneously as soon as they are available (as adults do) or whether they initially process them separately and integrate them later. Using electrophysiological measures, we examined the online neurocognitive processing of gesture-speech integration in 6- to 7-year-old children. We focused on the N400 event-related potential component which is modulated by semantic integration load. Children watched video clips of matching or mismatching gesture-speech combinations, which varied the semantic integration load. The ERPs showed that the amplitude of the N400 was larger in the mismatching condition than in the matching condition. This finding provides the first neural evidence that by the ages of 6 or 7, children integrate multimodal semantic information in an online fashion comparable to that of adults.

We tested this assumption by collecting data about the concept of "landscape" from speakers of seven languages of European origin. Speakers were asked to freely list exemplars to "landscape" (a concrete concept for which the underlying conceptual structure is unclear), "animals" (a concrete and discrete concept) and "body parts" (a concrete concept characterised by segmentation). We found, across languages, participants considered listing landscape terms the hardest task, listed fewest exemplars, had the least number of shared exemplars, and had fewer common co-occurrence pairs (i.e., pairs of exemplars listed adjacently). We also found important differences between languages in the types of exemplars that were cognitively salient and, most importantly, in how the exemplars are connected to each other in semantic networks. Overall, this shows that "landscape" is more weakly structured than other domains, with high variability both within and between languages. This diversity suggests that for sustainable landscape policies to be effective, they need to be better tailored to local conceptualisations.

Research findings from this area indicate that positive, neutral, and negative concepts are associated with upward, midward, and downward locations, respectively, in the vertical plane. The same research area has also indicated that such concepts seem to have no preferential location on the horizontal plane. The approach-avoidance effect consists in decreasing the distance between positive stimuli and the body (i.e. approach) and increasing the distance between negative stimuli and the body (i.e. avoid). Thus, the valence-space metaphor accounts for the mapping of valenced concepts onto the vertical and horizontal planes, and the approach-avoidance effect accounts for the mapping of valenced concepts onto the depth plane. By using a cube conceived for the study of allocation of valenced concepts onto 3D space, we show in three studies that positive concepts are placed in upward locations and near the participants' body, negative concepts are placed in downward locations and far from the participants' body, and neutral concepts are placed in between these concepts in both planes.

Possible alleviation of symptoms and side effects through clinicians' nocebo information and empathy in an experimental video vignette study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PSYCHOLOGICAL-FACTORS; PATIENTS ANXIETY; ANALOG PATIENTS; TRAIT ANXIETY; CANCER; PATIENT; COMMUNICATION; EXPECTATIONS; STYLES; PAIN	To alleviate anti-cancer treatment burden in advanced breast cancer, patient-clinician communication strategies based on nocebo-effect mechanisms are promising. We assessed distinct/combined effects on psychological outcomes (e.g. anxiety; main outcome) and side-effect expectations of (1) nocebo information about the (non)pharmacological origin of side effects, and (2) clinician-expressed empathy through reassurance of continuing support. Furthermore, we explored whether information and empathy effects on side-effect expectations were mediated by decreased anxiety. In a two-by-two experimental video-vignette design, 160 cancer patients/survivors and healthy women watched one of four videos differing in level of nocebo information (+/-) and empathy (+/-). Regression and mediation analysis were used to determine effects of information/empathy and explore anxiety's mediating role. Anxiety was not influenced by empathy or information (Stai-state: p = 0.295; p = 0.390, VAS p = 0.399; p = 0.823). Information improved (specific) side-effect coping expectations (p < 0.01). Empathy improved side-effect intensity expectations (p < 0.01 = specific; p < 0.05 = non-specific/partial) and specific side-effect probability expectations (p < 0.01), and increased satisfaction, trust, and self-efficacy (p < 0.001). No mediating effects were found of anxiety on expectations. Mainly empathy, but also nocebo information improved psychological outcomes and-mainly specific-side-effect expectations. Exploring the power of these communication elements in clinical practice is essential to diminish the anti-cancer treatment burden in advanced breast cancer.	[Meijers, M. C.; Evers, A. W.

Although interactive repair requires sophisticated cognitive abilities, it can be dissected into basic building blocks shared with non-human animal species. A review of the primate literature shows that interactionally contingent signal sequences are at least common among species of non-human great apes, suggesting a gradual evolution of repair. To pioneer a cross-species assessment of repair this paper aims at (i) identifying necessary precursors of human interactive repair; (ii) proposing a coding framework for its comparative study in humans and non-human species; and (iii) using this framework to analyse examples of interactions of humans (adults/children) and non-human great apes. We hope this paper will serve as a primer for cross-species comparisons of communicative breakdowns and how they are repaired.This article is part of the theme issue 'Revisiting the human 'interaction engine': comparative approaches to social action coordination'.

Are Health Care Professionals' Implicit and Explicit Attitudes Toward Conventional Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs Associated With Those of Their Patients?	ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH			English	Article							IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; QUESTIONNAIRE; INTERVENTION; NONADHERENCE; MEDICINES; BELIEFS; BIAS	Objective It is generally unknown how the attitudes and beliefs of health care professionals (HCPs) might affect the attitudes, beliefs, and medication-taking behavior of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aims 1) to examine the attitudes, health-related associations (both implicit and explicit), and beliefs of HCPs about conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and 2) to assess whether these attitudes, health-related associations, and beliefs of HCPs are associated with those of their patients, with their patients' medication-taking behavior, and disease activity. Methods HCPs were recruited from 2 centers that specialized in rheumatology across The Netherlands, and patient recruitment followed. In this observational study, implicit outcomes were measured with single-category implicit association tests, whereas explicit outcomes were measured with a bipolar evaluative adjective scale and the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire-Specific. Spearman's rank correlations were used to describe correlations between implicit and explicit measures of the attitudes of HCPs. Multilevel, mixed-effects linear models were used to examine the association of HCP-related characteristics, including the implicit and explicit outcomes of HCPs, with those of their patients, their medication-taking behaviors, and disease activity. Results Of the 1,659 initially invited patients, 254 patients with RA (mean age 62.8 years, mean disease duration 11.8 years, and 68.1% of the patients were female) who were treated by 26 different HCPs agreed to participate in this study. The characteristics, attitudes, health-related associations, and beliefs about medicines of HCPs were not significantly associated with those of their patients, nor with their medication-taking behaviors or disease activity scores. Conclusion This study demonstrated that the attitudes, health-related associations (as measured both implicitly and explicitly), and beliefs of HCPs were not significantly associated with the attitudes, beliefs, medication-taking behavior, and disease activity of patients with RA.

The dataset contains audio/video and motion-tracking recordings of face-to-face, task-based communicative interactions in Dutch, as well as behavioural and neural correlates of participants' representations of dialogue referents. Seventy-one pairs of unacquainted participants performed two interleaved interactional tasks in which they described and located 16 novel geometrical objects (i.e., Fribbles) yielding spontaneous interactions of about one hour. We share high-quality video (from three cameras), audio (from head-mounted microphones), and motion-tracking (Kinect) data, as well as speech transcripts of the interactions. Before and after engaging in the face-to-face communicative interactions, participants' individual representations of the 16 Fribbles were estimated. Behaviourally, participants provided a written description (one to three words) for each Fribble and positioned them along 29 independent conceptual dimensions (e.g., rounded, human, au-dible). Neurally, fMRI signal evoked by each Fribble was measured during a one-back working-memory task. To enable functional hyperalignment across participants, the dataset also includes fMRI measurements obtained during visual presentation of eight animated movies (35 min total). We present analyses for the various types of data demonstrating their quality and consistency with earlier research. Besides high-resolution multimodal in-teractional data, this dataset includes different correlates of communicative referents, obtained before and after face-to-face dialogue, allowing for novel investigations into the relation between communicative behaviours and the representational space shared by communicators. This unique combination of data can be used for research in neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, and beyond.

Implicit and explicit attitudes towards disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs as possible target for improving medication adherence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ASSOCIATION TEST; SOCIAL COGNITION; QUESTIONNAIRE; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS	Objective This study aims to explore the contribution of implicit attitudes and associations towards conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), alongside explicit measures, on medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods In this observational study, implicit attitudes (positive-negative) and health-related associations (health-sickness) were measured with Single Category Implicit Association Tests, whereas explicit outcomes were measured with a bipolar evaluative adjective scale and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire Specific. The primary outcome of this study was medication-taking behaviour subjectively measured by self-report (i.e. validated Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology) and objectively measured with electronic drug monitors over a 3 month period. Spearman rank correlations were used to describe correlations between implicit and explicit outcomes. Nested linear regression models were used to assess the additional value of implicit measures over explicit measures and patient-, clinical-, and treatment-related characteristics. Results Of the 1659 initially-invited patients, 254 patients with RA agreed to participate in this study. Implicit attitudes correlated significantly with necessity-concerns differential (NCD) scores (rho = 0.13, P = 0.05) and disease activity scores (rho = -0.17, P = 0.04), whereas implicit health-related associations correlated significantly with mean scores for explicitly reported health-related associations (rho = 0.18, P = 0.004). Significant differences in age, number of DMARDs, biologic DMARD use, NCD-scores, and self-reported correct dosing were found between the four attitudinal profiles. Nested linear regression models revealed no additional value of implicit measures in explaining self-reported medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes, over and above all other variables. Conclusion Implicit attitudes and associations had no additional value in explaining medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes over and above often used explicitly measured characteristics, attitudes and outcomes in the studied population. Only age and NCD scores contributed significantly when the dependent variable was correct dosing measured with self-report.	[van Heuckelum, M.; Flendrie, M.; van den Ende, C. H.

Because social scientific work in this area is relatively new and is rapidly evolving numerous conceptualizations of meaningful media experiences have been introduced. In this paper we argue for the importance of recognizing a unique form of media experience that causes us to look beyond our own concerns, to recognize moral beauty, and to feel unity with humanity and nature-what we label here as "self-transcendent media experiences."

That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks to exclude its influence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we benefit from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds. All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key questions for the future. Writing as a transdisciplinary collective assembled from across the classic cognitive science hexagon and beyond, we highlight the opportunity for a figure-ground reversal that puts interaction at the heart of cognition. The interactive stance is a way of seeing that deserves to be a key part of the conceptual toolkit of cognitive scientists.
